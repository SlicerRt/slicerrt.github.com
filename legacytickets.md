* where it is from (at least institution, preferably group, PI, contact person)
* what hardware and software was used to acquire/process/generate the data

thanks!

#### 2012-01-06, 16:43:25 - wangk
I just uploaded another RT plan which is an IMRT plan using the same phantom images.

I have added a readme file to the files I uploaded also.

## #12 Build Slicer4 with DCMRT
The CTK toolkit already downloads, builds, and uses DCMTK, and Slicer uses CTK, so Slicer already uses DCMTK. Probably CTK uses the latest stable DCMTK release. However, the package that contains DCMRT (the link that Steve sent) is a newer version of DCMTK.

Could you please try to patch the DCMTK in Slicer-4.0-bin\\CTK-build\\DCMTK\\ with this new DCMTK? One option would be to just add the dcmrt directory and modify a few CMakeLists.txt files to include the new directory in the build (the risk is that dcmrt could rely on some changes that were introduced since the last stable release). The other option would be to completely replace the DCMTK with the new version (the risk is that the new DCMTK may not be fully stable or fully compatible with the current CTK).

Csaba, Kevin, please work together on this and coordinate who does what and when. Let me know if you make any progress (or really stuck).

The data-centered concept of the Subject Hierarchy could be considered as an 'A'-type solution (from the referenced wiki page in the ticket description: 'A: make Slicer simpler to use (make it usable for an average clinician), showing only simplified GUI, only with the essential tools').

The simplified GUI is the Subject Hierarchy tree (convenient central organizing point for basic features), and the essential tools are the collection of the plugins we consider 'core'.

#### 2015-09-17, 19:05:25 - Csaba Pinter
@lassoan Only two items are still pending in this ticket:
* Timestamp for MRML nodes
* Textured models
If this two are not needed any more, then we can close the ticket. The timestamp was considered high priority at the time, but never came up again (also I would think it is more needed for IGT then RT, so if it has not come up there either, then it might be an obsolete request). Same for the textured models. What do you think?

#### 2015-09-21, 21:40:54 - Andras Lasso
These are not related to SlicerRT, so I agree that they don't need to be tracked here.

## #15 Prepare for DICOM-RT breakout session
Get familiar with DICOM-RT (see links at the project page http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2012_Winter_Project_Week:RTTools): 
* read the DCMRT pages on DCMTK's wiki
* familiarize yourself with the DICOM standard: read Part 1, skim through Part 3 and Part 5, read throroughly Supplement 11 
Get familiar with Slicer4 usage
Get familiar with how DICOM importing works in Slicer4 now (unfortunately - or interestingly? - it's implemented mainly in Python):
* Slicer-4.0\\Modules\\Scripted\\Scripts\\DICOM.py
* Slicer-4.0\\Modules\\Scripted\\DICOMLib
* Slicer-4.0-bin\\CTK\\Libs\\DICOM
Think about what we want to achieve in the first step (basically image, dose, and structure set import)
Think about how we could implement that => *Important! create a few powerpoint slides from the results of this step (we'll use it to guide the discussion)*
* how the DICOM-RT import should work from the user perspective (GUI, workflow)?
* what kind of MRML objects should we import the data into (label maps, surface models, annotation objects...)?
* what are the design options? how could we extend the current DICOM importing method without changing it too much?

## #16 DicomRtImport loadable module for Slicer4
* Create an extension module: DicomRtImport (Csaba)
* Call a method of the DicomRtImport module when the user requests DICOM object loading. Method's input: UID. If the method finds a structure set then it adds it to the scene. (Csaba)
* Create a VTK filter that can read structure set from a DICOM-RT structure set and has a vtkPolyData output (Kevin)
* Integrate the VTK filter into the DicomRtImport module (Kevin)
* Add the vtkPolyData to the scene as a MRML model node (Kevin/Csaba)

* Hide the module from the module list
* Make the module pluggable into the DICOM import system

The model to labelmap module now works well for ribbonized planar contours (the format used now for structure sets).

The module now uses vtkImageStencil instead of the old (flood-filling based) method. This method should replace the old implementation in Slicer because the old method has severe limitations.

Limitations of the old (flood-filling based) method:
* it assumes that the center-of-gravity of the volume was inside the volume (it is certainly not always correct, e.g., donut shape or bean shape), when the assumption is incorrect then an inverted labelmap is generated
* if the model points do not fully cover the the top and bottom slice then the flood-filling leaks out and the result is an empty labelmap
* open surfaces near highly changing contours may leak and the results is an empty labelmap
* only the points in the polydata are used (connectivity information is not utilized)
* very slow

## #22 Create Slicer node bundle module for 3D+t data representation
*Each dataset in a node + a bundle node
*need timestamp info: it could be stored in the node (in a node attribute) or in the bundle node
*The 4D image module could be extended to handle multiple objects and additional object type
*can be naturally extended to support multiple nodes and different node types
*a bundle node could contain another bundle node
*How to do processing manually if there are tens of different time points? Could be an option to show/hide nodes that are part of a time bundle. CLI modules could be easily applied to each contained node one-by-one.
*memory management could be an issue
*Implement HHSC model: original and valid time

http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/AHM2012-3D-US-Slicer-Breakout

Use cases:
*adaptive radiotherapy: track changes between 3D images acquired at different times
*inter-volume registration; if there is one 4D node then it's difficult to run existing slicer registration modules
*DCE-MRI
*2D+t ultrasound
*3D+t ultrasound
*population studies

## #24 DICOM import in Slicer is slow
Need to speed up the DICOM import in Slicer. Maybe just buy reading/parsing the fields that will be displayed in the DICOM browser window?

Profiling on Windows7 in debug mode showed that the main culprit is FlushFileBuffers (called by QSqlQuery::exec). Therefore, a first target for the performance optimization should be the SQL database management.

We could have a look at utilizing DICOMDIR files both for making the import faster. The DICOMDIR file is often available for DICOM files that were written to a physical medium. See more details in Part 10 of the DICOM standard: http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_10pu.pdf


#### 2012-01-31, 18:16:00 - pieper
Marco Nolden of DKFZ said that he's got a student working on adding DICOMDIR support to ctkDICOMDatabase - we could check with him on the status of that.

This may explain the bad performance: http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q19
 
Thus, it seems that we have multiple options to make the DICOM import much faster:
-          We could consider simply use PRAGMA synchronous=OFF (as the DICOM database acts as a cache only, all the information is stored in the DICOM files themselves)
-          Do all the insertions in one commit: more complex implementation, but this way we can ensure DB integrity (even in case of a power failure, etc.)

Adding the following lines to the end of ctkDICOMDatabase::openDatabase(const QString databaseFile, const QString& connectionName ) makes the import much faster:
  //Disable synchronous writing to make modifications faster
  QSqlQuery pragmaSyncQuery(d->Database);
  pragmaSyncQuery.exec('PRAGMA synchronous = OFF');
  pragmaSyncQuery.finish();

## #25 Patient name is not always displayed correctly in the Slicer DICOM browser
In the Slicer DICOM browser the patient name sometimes contains ^ characters (the ^ characters are supposed to separate first/last/middle names and should not be displayed). It is reproducible with the SlicerRt test data set (https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/SlicerRt/data/), see the attached screenshot.

Thank you, Steve!

I tried it and made a screenshot.
Andras, if you consider the screenshot above good, then we can consider it solved.

This ticket should be closed once this change appears in the CTK release used by Slicer superbuild

#### 2012-12-12, 15:57:10 - Andras Lasso
Csaba, thanks for the screenshot.

@pieper: The fix is almost good, there are just two things:
* On all the DICOM browsers the patient name is displayed as Lastname, Firstname (see https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/documents/dtiEq-rPSr4A27acwqjQYw/download/dtiEq-rPSr4A27acwqjQYw), so if there is one hardcoded way to display the patient name it should be Lastname, Firstname
* In the SlicerRT test data set there is a patient that has slightly different name in different series: 'PHANTOM, fourD' and 'PHANTOM^FourD^^'. It would be OK to either merge these patients or list as two separate patients. However, currently they appear in the tree as two different patients at the patient level, but all the series appear under the same patient ('PHANTOM, fourD'). Maybe the patient matching is somewhere implemented a simple string compare on the patient name and some other places it's an approximate matching (and maybe using other fields, such as patient id and birth date).


#### 2012-12-12, 20:05:47 - pieper
The current version (first middle last, suffix) is what dcmtk gives by default for the formatted string extracted from the ^ delimited version.  But there's another option to get the  names as independent parts.   So I propose we should be able to display as: last, first middle, suffix

For the PHANTOM, fourD scan, I suspect the issue actually lies in the patient ID field since the name shouldn't be the unique key.  Can you attach (or send me) two files that lead to this issue so we can test?

#### 2012-12-12, 20:19:43 - Andras Lasso

Thanks, Steve!
This is the current state above. The patient name looks good now. 
Looking at the DICOM tags of the fourD phantom dataset, it seems that the patient names are not the same.
I think it should be the Patient ID that groups them together instead of the patient name.

Now that I took a closer look, the 'age' field is filled with imaging modality information. is this the intended effect? am I missing something here?

#### 2012-12-14, 17:47:33 - Andras Lasso
Age: the issue is that the column headings are the same for patient, study, series level, while the information is clearly different. The proper implementation would be to have separate column heading for each level (or have multiple lists instead of a tree). It's a separate issue, I've added #199 to keep track of that.

#### 2012-12-14, 17:48:11 - Csaba Pinter
I haven't noticed it, good catch! I think it is something to fix. I've created a Slicer mantis issue for it (http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2828)

#### 2012-12-14, 18:06:51 - Andras Lasso
Unfortunately, the DICOM standard doesn't specify how to determine if two series belong to the same patient or not. Patient ID is not a unique identifier (see http://fixunix.com/dicom/497052-dangers-assuming-patient-id-unique-key.html). Usually the patient name and ID are compared, as they are both mandatory fields, but due to the lack of standard Slicer could implement any behavior, as long as it's consistent throughout the application.

The main problem with the current Slicer behavior that it is inconsistent:
* [PHANTOM, fourD] and [PHANTOM^FourD^^] are considered _different_ when the patient branches are created in the tree
* [PHANTOM, fourD] and [PHANTOM^FourD^^] are considered _equal_ when the series items are placed into the patient branch (because all series are placed under the [PHANTOM, fourD] branch)

A good behavior could be: treat two patients to be the same if patient names and ids are the same, compared in a case-insensitive and character encoding neutral manner.


#### 2012-12-14, 18:38:31 - pieper
Thanks for the info Csaba - lots of things to think about on this one.  Julien, Jc, and I have been discussing it at length and are considering several options.

It seems to us that we should be very careful with the import and display of cases like this, since the PatientID is not 'globally' unique (the same ID may be used by different hospitals to refer to different people).  We might want to have On the other hand, the same PatientID with different PatientNames can happen due to a typo or spelling variant in the PatientName, like the PHANTOM, fourD vs PHANTOM^FourD^^ example here.

We think it makes the most sense to detect these issues and display them to the user, with the option to resolve the issues in the database (not modifying the original dicom files).

Probably this basically similar to the underlying issue of #36, where the PatientName fields are inconsistent across series within the same study and probably should be dealt with together.

I envision a tool that checks the ctkDICOMDatabase for consistency according to a number of rules that we'll need to define.  Then we'll need to have a set of corrective actions that the user will need to manually review and approve.

Another option is to consider the PatientName+PatientID as the main key, so that studies with unique PatientNames are not grouped together in the browser tree.  This seems fail safe, but not as useful.

While we consider these longer term options we'll keep looking at this issue.

#### 2012-12-14, 19:18:05 - pieper
We looked at a couple possible solutions to this, but the fact remains that when multiple series have the same StudyUID, but different study level or patient level information the only viable option is to make only 'obvious' corrections automatically, and requesting user input on non-obvious issues.

#### 2012-12-14, 19:23:40 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, this seems to be the best solution.
We can still implement heuristics to set the most probable default choices, so that most of the time the user has to click only 1.

#### 2012-12-14, 19:26:47 - pieper
As a small aside, these issues (#25 and #36) are in the ctkDICOMDatabase code, so the issues should be tracked in the ctk issue tracker with the DICOM tag and cross-links back to slicer or slicerrt as needed.

Tie same issue came back with the new DICOM browser

#### 2017-07-28, 18:52:30 - Csaba Pinter
In relation to a project this issue came up again, specifically the handling of the same patient when their name is stored different ways (for MR it's 'DOE^JOHN', for US it's 'DOE^JOHN^^^').

Just to record the discussion with Andras about this issue:
* Showing the patient name and other fields (date etc.) in a human-readable way could be achieved by implementing and using a new model class for ctkDICOMTableView
** CTK uses a simple QSqlQueryModel instead of which the new model could be set
* Features of the new model
** Parse different columns differently (name, date, etc.) and set this parsed text to the item to show
** Edit fields: Many times the test data has the same and/or meaningless name (test phantom etc.)
** Convert the changed value back to DICOM readable format and write it to the SQL database
** Additionally it would be nice if the header texts could be converted to human readable as well (now they are 'PatientsName', 'StudyDate', etc.)

#### 2017-07-28, 22:26:22 - pieper
Those are good ideas - maybe this should be reported as a CTK issue.


## #26 Modality list does not include RT objects in the Slicer DICOM browser
Add RTI, RTD, RTSS, RTP as categories (RT image, RT dose, RT structure set, RT plan).
If this would mean to many displayed items then maybe only those modalities should be listed that exist in the database.

## #27 DICOM browser layout in Slicer is not optimal
* The tree view is too small
* The fields at different levels (patient, study, series, image) are different (patient name makes sense only at patient level, series description makes sense only at series level, ...), therefore a tree view is maybe not ideal, but separate lists could be better

* Need to customize the columns for RT (and probably for other IODs as well):
** list of columns
** which DICOM fields are used to fill them (check what is done in CERR, dicompyler, or other open-source implementations + commercial systems)
** which DICOM fields should be stored in the DB (schema changes)

Questions:
* Should we use a merged patient&study level as the highest hierarchy level?
** Pro: most patients seem to have only one study, there would be less hierarchy levels; patient data in different studies may differ, this way it can be all shown
** Con: does not reflect the actual DICOM data levels
* Should we show a tree (Osirix, K-PACS, CERR, InVivoScope, Dicompyler) or simple lists (DeVide, ClearCanvas, RayStation, MIM, Conquest, AdvSim)
** Pro tree: item selection has better granularity (most list-based solutions allow only patient or study level selection only and load everything that belongs there)
** Pro list: somewhat easier to manipulate (don’t have to click on small [+] buttons)
* Separate first and last name?
* Which fields we should store in the database, which ones we should display, and how to determine the values from the DICOM files? (see analysis in file:DicomPatientBrowserFields.xlsx

This material is very helpful.

I addressed some of these issues in the latest checkin to the trunk which is basically what I was working on before RSNA but finally debugged enough to be able to check it in.
 
http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/Slicer4?view=revision&revision=19131

It would be good to review this new interface in terms of the research you've been doing on standards in the field.

One usability question: what do people think about the popup widget?  I'm thinking of replacing it with code that would take over the 'central widget' of the interface (basically replace all the slicer and 3d viewers with the contents of the dicom widget (or with some follow up implementation).

## #28 Dose map image coordinate system has to be transformed during import
When loading a dose map into slicer with the standard DICOM image loading method then it appears in a different size and location compared to the anatomical image and contours, because it's defined in a different coordinate system.

Convert the dose map into the same coordinate system as the anatomical image. Maybe insert it into the scene under a transform node.

## #29 RT images should be imported as a series of single-slice images
Currently RT images (RTIMAGE IOD, typically portal images) are loaded as a single 3D volume, while they are actually a set of 2D images. It would be better to import them as separate single-slice 3D volumes.

The loaded slices need to be placed at the proper positions.
Beam geometry models reach from the source to the corresponding RT Image (if available).

Remaining task:

Scaling of the x axis is not meaningful. We just show the dimensionless value that is stored in the voxels, while absolute dose values (Gy) or relative dose values should be displayed instead. Need to use the (3004,000e) DoseGridScaling, (3004,0002) DoseUnits, etc. values in the DICOM header. Probably we should read these fields from the DICOM header and store them as MRML node attributes.

Select existing or new chart to add the values to.

Currently DVH generation from a single labelmap is enough. Later the DVH generation could work from directly using a model hierarchy.

Based on the feedback of prospective users (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/sparkit/wiki/20120213_SlicerRt_meeting_at_ImNO2012) this doesn't seem to be a very important feature. Anyway, the effect can be achieved by using discrete colormaps or grayscale model maker and slice intersections.

Others reported that they would like to have isodose line display, so let's do at least a basic implementation.

Two design options:
A. Have one model with multiple isodose surfaces, color it with scalar values. Advantage: we don't add too many MRML nodes, easy to show/hide all of them at once.
B. Have one model for each isodose surface, color it with the surface color. Advantage: each surface can be turned on/off individually, color can be changed easily, the model name can contain the dose value.
=> To decide ask people and check how it is done in other software.

Would be nice to show a color bar (or text in the isodose line intersections) that specifies which line correspond to which dose value. It could be done by implementing a generic colormap display widget that could show the colormap and labels in the 2D and 3D viewers.

Thanks Kevin, you're making progress.

Ultimately the GUI should look something like this (just a proposal, we can discuss, would be useful to see the GUI of existing software and implement something that is familiar for users):

Dose Volume: ***node selector listbox ***
Isodose levels ( ***label: Gy or %, depending on Level mode*** ): ***editbox; default: 100, 95, 90, 50, 30, 10***
Level mode: ***listbox with 2 options: Percentage of reference level / Absolute; default: percentage***
Reference level (Gy): ***editbox, enabled only if Level mode is Percentage of reference level; default***
***Update or apply button***
***checkbox*** Show isodose lines
***checkbox*** Show isodose surfaces
***checkbox*** Show scalar bar

* Remove the Parent hierarchy node selector. Just create a new hierarchy node and store a reference to that node in the vtkMRMLIsodoseNode internally, don't expose the selection to the user.
* If the user changes the levels then remove all the models under that hierarchy node and replace with the new levels.
* Use the dose volume name (e.g., DoseDay1) as name for the model hierarchy and add the reference dose level as well if the mode is percentage (e.g., 'DoseDay1 Isodose (100% = 48Gy)')
* Use the levels for naming the models (e.g., '10 Gy' or '25 %')
* We may also update the colormap based on the specified reference value

If we add more features that are not strictly related to isodose (such as colormap definition) then we should rename the Isodose module to have a more generic name (e.g., 'Dose visualization').

I have just talked with our postdoc here. he showed me a couple of software. it seems that they only use absolute value when computing isodose lines. 

I think we have many options regarding how to compute and how to display. so I think we need to discuss in our next weekly meeting.





#### 2012-08-22, 20:55:30 - Andras Lasso
OK, let's discuss it then. Please work on the obvious stuff till then (naming of the model hierarchy and dose surface models, show/hide lines and surfaces, update models by removing and recreating them if levels are changed, etc.) and also prepare a GUI proposal (just a single ppt slide) that we can discuss on Monday.

#### 2012-08-27, 19:38:16 - Andras Lasso

After some investigation, I found the qMRMLColorTableView widget is not good for our iso level definition. 

the qMRMLColorTableView  widget is a good gui representation for vtklookuptable class. however, to use vtklookuptable with scalar range (0,255), we will have a lookup table that has 256 entries. we do not want to have so many entries. so we have to use vtkcolortransferfunction class. but qMRMLColorTableView  has limited support for that class. when you copy a vtkcolortransferfunction, it creates an equvilent vtklookuptable then you can modify that. 

so we cannot use qMRMLColorTableView widget in isodose module. either derive a new class from QTableView to make a new widget or use QTableView directly which is what we did before.

Any comments?

#### 2012-09-06, 20:12:06 - Csaba Pinter
The qMRMLColorTableView widget displays the structure colors lookup table the way it should, with only showing the entries linked to each structure, instead of 256 entries.
Maybe the key is the type you set to the vtkMRMLColorTableNode to display. There are many types, you can see them in the source code of the node. The way I used the node you can see in vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic.cxx

#### 2012-09-06, 20:30:50 - wangk
I have looked at code in vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic.cxx. I think I have found a way to use vtkMRMLColorTableNode. I was looking at using the color index to store the isodose levels which is not possible. but we can also use color name to store the isodose levels. thanks.

Very nice work, Kevin!

A few suggestions:
* When I switch between Isodose parameter sets the rest of the GUI is not updated
* I have to click 'Show isodose surfaces' to make the isodose lines to appear
* Include the name of the isodose 'Parameter set' in the Model hierarchy name (instead of 'RTDOSE - isosurface' have something like 'MyIsoDoseParameterNodeName: RTDOSE')
* Use a somewhat wider range of dose values by default (currently it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Gy; it could be something like 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 Gy)
* In the output you can print out the generated model hierarchy name (or you can just remove that section)
* Move the display options below the Apply, because Apply is only for the label configuration (everything else is applied automatically, immediately)

## #35 Create a plug-in mechanism for customizing DICOM import
When importing DICOM objects Slicer should allow custom modules to do the import. Similar design could work as for other file I/O or editor plugins.

The DICOM file reading and parsing shall be done only once and the same DCMTK object should be passed to each plugin (reading+parsing in each plugin would take too much time).

If none of the custom modules can import the data then the default Slicer importer will try to load it. If multiple modules can read it then it could be possible to define priorities (advantage: there would be no need for extra popups and clicks for the user) or ask the user which importer it wants to use (more generic, but require more clicks, which can be annoying).

Hi Guys - 

I've been thinking a lot about this one - I would like to generalize the whole dicom module so that even the 'standard' structural volume use case is factored out as a plugin.  I would like to see scalar volumes and dwi volumes as two early examples of plugins.  Then we can handle a lot of cases as future plugins (SR, segmentations, transforms, surfaces...) and keep the module simpler.

To avoid reloading all of the datasets for each of the plugins I'm looking at various ways to cache the header data in a way that it can be converted back into a DcmDataset without needing to re-read all of the data files.  DWI is pretty much the worst case of this since there can be hundreds of files in a series.  CT can also be problematic here.  I'm thinking it might make sense to cache the xml representation of a DcmDataset and then the plugin could request the minimal data version of the dataset (reconstructed from the xml) when organizing the data or the full data version (re-read from the file) when actually reading the data into memory.

Do you have a proposal for what the API for the plugin superclass would look like?  I'm thinking it should probably be at the ctkDICOM level so that an instance of the ctkDICOMDatabase could be passed in, along with the UIDs of the patient/study/series that the user has selected.  From this the plugin would send back a list of loading options that it would know how to convert into MRML.  (This would be like the organizeVolumes and offerVolumes functionality in the DICOMDataExchange.py code).  
 
-Steve

#### 2012-01-31, 00:08:37 - Andras Lasso
> I would like to generalize the whole dicom module so that even the 'standard' structural volume use case is factored out as a plugin. 
Very good idea, completely agree.

> I'm looking at various ways to cache the header data
DICOM is a more compact data storage format, so file sizes are probably smaller than XML. DCMTK does the DICOM parsing pretty quickly, may be faster than parse the same amount of XML. So, having a cache in XML may or may not be faster. Of course, if we store only a subset of fields in the cache then it'll be fast (but then maybe some required data will be missing for some plugins). We could have a look at utilizing DICOMDIR files both for making the import faster (as this file is often available on DICOM files that were written to a physical medium) and maybe for some additional information caching. Anyway, probably we should go for the simplest implementation first (no cache) and then use a profiler to find performance bottlenecks (by the way it seems that currently the DICOM import is so slow because of the SQL queries are very slow, see more details in #24). 

> Do you have a proposal for what the API for the plugin superclass would look like?
The proposal that you described looks good.


#### 2012-01-31, 16:20:07 - Csaba Pinter
Steve,
The proposed design makes a lot of sense. I'll have time in the second part of the week and I'm going to take a closer look, maybe do a prototype if I get that far.

#### 2012-01-31, 18:25:09 - pieper
Regarding the XML part:  I was looking at this as a convenient way to cache the header data in a way that could be stored easily (for example, in sqlite) but could be reconstituted into a DcmDataset when needed.  

Another option would be to save dicom files with the pixel data removed so they could be reloaded quickly and with not much memory footprint.  One option for this would be to save an entire series worth of headers in one file consisting of multiple DcmDatasets with the pixeldata elements removed.  This would be quick to reload and one could send a whole patient's worth of these headers down to the plugins for evaluation and parsing.

Agreed we should prototype before doing too much optimization.  Perhaps the best thing to do is implement the skeleton of the plugin architecture first and just pass lists of filenames around and let each plugin reparse the files.  Then we can streamline from there.





#### 2012-01-31, 18:58:38 - Andras Lasso
OK, to prevent premature optimization let's go with the simplest parameters, which are basically those that we use now (file names and intended object names).

We still need to define an interface for returning the list of objects that a plugin can load. Slicer would collect the list of loadable object names&types from all the plugins and would display a list where the user could choose from:



~~~~


Load |   Object name   |   Object type   |   Importer
-----+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------
[X]  |   Plan1 SS      |  Structure sets | DICOM-RT

## #36 DICOM files without complete patient and study info can cause incomplete DICOM database records
Certain study-level fields (such as study description, institution name, etc.) are defined only for anatomical images, but not for RTSTRUCT (and other RT IODs). If RTSTRUCT is parsed first then the tree doesn't contain the study info.

Potential solution:
* Save patient, study, series level fields (patient name, study secription, etc.) at the image level. This would allow storage of all information in the DB without any data loss
* At the end of any DB importing or editing go through all the updated patients and save the consolidated (appended descriptions, most recent non-empty patient name, etc.) values at the patient, study, series level

Can you point to a study that has this property?  (i.e. a study where the patient data is different between two series in the same study).  Ideally if you could attach two files that demonstrate this issue it would help with testing.

I think the best solution here is to refactor the insert method of ctkDICOMDatabase (it is long an hard to understand).  As part of that we could better isolate code that deals with optimizing the insert mechanism and also doublecheck for inconsistencies in the data.  Probably we should generate a warning for this situation, but also try to auto-correct it if the answer seems obvious (by obvious I mean that the patient name is blank for a given patient ID, but then later a non-blank name is provided).

#### 2012-12-14, 17:30:44 - Andras Lasso
All RT studies are like this: the CT series typically contains much more information than the RT dose, structure set, etc. series. Fields that are present in CT but usually missing from RT series: institution, referring physician, study description, ...

I think a good solution would be to store all the study information at the series level (because all the same fields of the same study can have different values in different series). In addition to this, a consolidated value (combined from all the series in the study) could be stored at the study level. The consolidation step could happen at the end of each import step (after all the files have been imported), just using the contents that are already in the database.

#### 2012-12-14, 19:21:21 - pieper
Andras: when you say that 'all RT studies are like this' do you mean all the research cases, or this is a standard practice in the clinic?  If it is a standard convention, then we could implement a rule that ignores patient and study level information from all RT series because they are not reliable. On the other hand if this is more of an ad-hoc research convention then we should make the user manually reconcile the information.

Either way it seems like invalid DICOM data, but something we need to accommodate cleanly.

#### 2012-12-14, 19:26:05 - Andras Lasso
These are DICOM files produced by performing usual RT workflows on phantom data. I think all files conform to the DICOM standard.

I think loss-less storage of all fields at series level and storing composite values at study level is a good solution. What do you think?

#### 2012-12-14, 19:33:05 - pieper
Hmmm... I'm having trouble imaging a situation where the DICOM spec would endorse the idea of different patient-level information occurring within the same study.  It's supposed to be a study of a particular person, so it seems like an error if things like patient name can change from series to series.  (But the spec allows some odd things, so maybe we should consult someone more knowledgeable for advice).

Keeping all the patient and study level data with each series seems like a lot of into to keep (and a complex schema to maintain).  But we need to sort this out one way or another.  I'm thinking that we might need a less rigid schema if we anticipate a lot of this kind of variability in the wild.

#### 2012-12-14, 20:02:57 - Andras Lasso
You can create a patient on different systems (CT scanner, treatment planning system, MRI scanner, ...) with as many details as you want: you may enter patient birth date on the CT but not enter it when you do the MRI scan. This is perfectly valid, DICOM compliant. However, this means that you cannot fill the study or patient level information from only one series, but you have to have all the data and then decide what you display for the user.

For the consolidation of patient or study level field values into one displayable value you need to know the value stored in each series. So, you either have to re-read the values from the DICOM files on each insert and delete; or store all the values in the database. I think storing the values in the database is much more efficient and allows a simpler implementation of the consolidation mechanism. There is nothing complicated in the schema: you store all the values that you read from a file (or series) at the lowest level in the database (at file or series level). At higher levels nothing has to be changed, you compose the values from the low-level fields according to the compositing logic.

The advantage of storing all the field values before consolidation is that you can re-run the consolidation whenever you want (e.g., if you install a new plugin or a new software version you don't have to re-build the database).

The compositing logic could be just appending values with a ',' separator, showing each value only once.

Example:
Series 1: Physician: A; Insitution: K
Series 2: Physician: B; Institution undefined
Series 3: Physician: A; Institution undefined
=> Shown at study level: Physician: A, B; Institution: K

Asking the user to resolve conflicts or confirm merges can be quite tricky, because we would need to store all these confirmations persistently somewhere so that when the database is rebuilt these confirmations can be applied again.


#### 2012-12-14, 20:07:22 - Andras Lasso
I agree that we should double-check this with a DICOM guru before making a final decision. Maybe ask David Clunie or somebody from the DCMTK group?

I think it would be very useful if we held a breakout session in SLC about these issues. We have quite a lot to discuss and decide in DICOM-related topics.
(Andras could also attend over skype or hangout.)

Steve, what do you think?

#### 2012-12-17, 18:42:59 - pieper
Yes, I think this is a great idea - something like the DICOM breakout we had in Boston at the summer meeting.  We can be very focused though, and sort out this issue and maybe a few other high priority ones.




#### 2012-12-17, 19:27:01 - pieper
Hi Andras - 

Regarding the scenario you listed above, I just want to clarify.

You said:

_'You can create a patient on different systems (CT scanner, treatment planning system, MRI scanner, ...) with as many details as you want: you may enter patient birth date on the CT but not enter it when you do the MRI scan. This is perfectly valid, DICOM compliant. However, this means that you cannot fill the study or patient level information from only one series, but you have to have all the data and then decide what you display for the user.'_

In this case the MR and CT would have different Study UIDs because they are different studies.  It's possible that the patient's name is misspelled or differently capitalized.  In this case we currently treat these as different patients even if they have the same PatientID field (The same way that if they had the same name, but different PatientIDs they would be different patients).

However the issue in the RT examples we have been looking at is that the CT and the treatment plan *have the same Study UID* which means that the RT data is based on the CT as it's reference data.  Since the RT data is derived from the CT it's not clear to me that it should be allowed to have different Patient or Study level data while sharing the same Study UID.

Again, I can easily see how this could happen in practice, but I don't think it's valid ;)

#### 2012-12-17, 21:33:03 - Gabor Fichtinger
This continues to be a hairy issue… Traditionally, it is true that “RT data is based on the CT as it's reference data”  - however, this is expected to change, because adaptive RT plans will be based on multiple image data sources, from different sources (CT, MRI) throughout the course of series of treatment fractions. –Gabor

Yes, Steve, you are right that the patient creation on CT/MRI was not a good example, as the StudyInstanceUID would be different in that case.

Anyway, there is inconsistent study information in CT and various RT IODs in data sets that we received from different hospitals, created with different treatment planning systems.

I've also checked a couple of TPS DICOM conformance statements, and they all explicitly state the study fields that they store in the RT IODs. The stored fields include the mandatory fields and a few random optional fields - but several optional study fields are simply ignored. 
See:

* http://www.nucletron.com/Resources/Documents/CIB-OSL192200%20Oncentra%20IMCON%20conf%20stat.pdf)

You might consider this behavior 'invalid', but this is what specified in the DICOM conformance statements of several FDA-approved devices.

## #37 Create a transform module that can apply any transform to DICOM-RT objects
The transform should be applicable to:
-Contours and points
-Dose maps
-Anatomical images

Non-linear transforms shall be supported.

In the first step it could be a separate module, but later it would be better to make it part of the transform hierarchy (so that transforms can be applied by drag-and-drop)

Kevin: 'I thought the Slicer Transform module will be used for all the DicomRT object. do you still need a separate module for this? I took a look at our current code. Most modules do not take transform into account, although it is easy to add this part. So do we need to add support of transform to all RT modules?'

#### 2012-12-10, 21:31:55 - Csaba Pinter
We discussed this with Kevin in the SlicerRT hangout today and it seems that transforming of the different data mentioned in the description is already possible through the Transform module and the handling of transforms in the Contour MRML node.
The Transform module can also handle deformable transformations, however, it cannot apply them to the objects.
Is there anything else that would be needed in this separate RT Transforms module?

#### 2012-12-11, 00:03:36 - Andras Lasso
We need application of non-linear transforms as well. We can already apply non-linear transform to an image by using various resample CLI modules, the only issue is that the additional metadata (dose unit, colormap, etc.) is not carried on to the resulting image.

The long-term solution is to define a 'reference' input for each output and use it to copy all metadata (put back the result image in the same location in the patient hierarchy as the reference image, etc.).

We might consider providing a temporary solution to this problem by introducing a special resample module that properly copies the metadata. However, it would be better if we could skip this and go for the long-term solution directly.

Platform-dependent Matlab RMI implementation and adapter for mlabwrap

Requirements:
* Shall not require Python
* Shall not require linking anything against Matlab libraries
* Should not require restart of Matlab at each script execution
* Should be available from Python and Slicer loadable modules (could be all done through CLI interface)

Implementation:
* CLI executer: an executable file, implemented in C++
* Opens the .xml file that has the same filename as the .exe
* Behaves as a CLI (but one single executable can be used for any number of modules without the need for rebuilding)
* responds to CLI interface description
* creates a proxy .m file that has the interface described by the CLI, reads the parameters from file or from command-line, calls a user-defined function
* if CLI execution is called

MyModule.exe => the user (or wizard) creates it by cloning (simple file copy)
MyModule.xml => the user (or wizard) creates it
MyModuleProxy.m => MyModule.exe creates it
MyModule.m => the user (or wizard) creates it (MyModule.exe can create a skeleton)

MatlabTcpServer.m => part of package, receives commands through TCP/IP and executes them
ModuleLauncher.exe => part of the package, user uses it to clone

## #41 Get patient browser screenshots from MGH
Hi Greg,

For improving Slicer's DICOM browser for RT more info is needed about the look&feel of patient browsing in planning/review workstations.

Greg, could you create a few screenshots of the patient browser of the workstations that you can access in MGH? It would be especially helpful if you could show how our test data sets (https://www.assembla.com/code/sparkit/subversion/nodes/trunk/SlicerRt/data) are displayed, because then we could determine which DICOM fields are shown and what is displayed if fields are missing, etc.

Please upload the screenshots as attachments to this ticket. Any additional information, explanation, improvement ideas are also welcome

Thanks!
Andras

Hi Andras,

## #45 Manipulation of larger CT volumes is not possible due to memory issues
Loading or manipulating of larger (512x512x250) CT volumes is not possible or very limited. Even if loading is successful, any processing requires memory allocation for the output volume, which typically fails.

Workaround: downsample large volumes before loading into Slicer

Potential solutions:
* Increase virtual memory size - but max memory for a 32-bit app is limited to 2GB anyway
* Run CLIs in separate process (add a Slicer application option for this on the GUI) - short-term only, helps only CLI modules
* Automatically resample large volumes when they are loaded - it could be useful anyway, for performance improvement
* Build Slicer in 64 bits
* Find out what causes the excessive memory consumption/fragmentation and fix the issue

We’ve found that due to the module renaming a number of modules have been loaded twice (both the old and the new version). After cleaning up all the old versions we can load somewhat more data, but still we run out of memory very quickly.

Used virtual memory size (measured by procexp.exe, “Virtual size”):
•  Startup: 1.191GB
•  After selecting the RANDO^PROSTATE/PELVIS CURATIVE CT dataset in the DICOM browser (not loaded yet): 1.315GB
•  After loading the CT: 1.411GB
•  After loading the CT (again): 1.506GB
•  After loading the CT (again): fails to load it
It doesn’t get too close to the theoretical 2GB max, so we seem to have quite a bit of memory fragmentation.

Win7 x64, Slicer 32-bit debug mode
Memory use (measured by Process explorer 'Virtual size') in GB:
* 0.653 nothing loaded
* 0.665 QT scripted only
* 0.698 QT loadable only
* 1.136 CLI only
* 1.191 everything loaded

=> CLI modules seems to be the main culprit (of course the base 0.653GB is quite a lot, too)

#### 2012-02-10, 22:08:03 - Andras Lasso
We can gain 500MB by unloading (or not even loading) the DLLs. This 500MB would probably be enough for basic use cases, demos, etc.

Options for CLI mem consumption problem fix would be:
A. make dll/exe interface preference adjustable by the user
B. unload CLI dlls after app start and load/unload upon request (when the user activates the module)

Option A. seems much simpler to implement (and solves the dll robustness issues, allows the CLI to access 2GB memory, etc.), so I think we should shoot for this one.

In addition, we could have a look at memory-hungry modules (the DICOM module is a candidate, as when we activate it the mem consumption grows by about 120MB). But it’s a lower priority compared to the CLI mem consumption problem.


#### 2012-02-10, 22:41:17 - Andras Lasso
Workaround: move all the .dll files from the plugins directory to somewhere else in the slicer path (like bin or something) but leave the exe files where they are.

## #46 Prepare a SlicerRt demo for ImNO
Prepare data sets and test them for the following demonstration:
* DICOM import of CT image, RTSS, and dose
* Registration: register two CTs and apply the transform to the dose and contours as well (through converting the contours to labelmaps, applying the transform, then converting back to model)


#### 2012-02-10, 20:00:25 - wangk
Here is the list of basic steps:

1.  load a DicomRT plan into slicer (including CT image, structure set and dose map)
2.  create a simple linear transform (change the translation and rotation parameters) using insert transform.
3.  resample the Original CT image to create the warped CT image using registration->resample image(Brains) module with the newly created transform.
4.  perform linear registration between original and warped CT image to calculate the transform using General registration (brains) module.
5.  apply the transform to dose map and labelmap or model from structure set.
6.  add warped dose map with original dose map to calculate the accumulated dose map.

This demos a very simple approach to accumulate the dose map adaptively during treatment. Of course you guys can throw in your ideas.

Potential implementation:
* for each contour:
** detect slice plane normals
** use the plane normal to decide if its a set of planar contours
* if all the contours are found to be planar and parallel (this should be true for the majority of the cases) then use the ribbon filter to expand the contour lines to ribbons (use the determined plane normal and ribbon thickness as inputs for the ribbon filter)
* if any of the contours are found to be non-planar then return with a warning and import the polylines as is (do not ribbonize)


#### 2012-02-28, 15:56:08 - wangk
Hi Andras, 

I think I know what the problem is. the input volume should be the original dicom image which has the correct spacing between slices. This is because that the 2D contours are constructed on the original dicom images so their spacing is same as the dicom spacing. Obviously the dose map volume has different spacing along z axis. 

#### 2012-02-28, 16:07:18 - Andras Lasso
We chose to create ribbons from the contour lines so that we can generate labelmaps for any volume. The only problem is that the ribbon width is hardcoded now.

#### 2012-02-28, 17:33:04 - Andras Lasso
As we discussed, the slice thickness of the original volume (the one that is stored in the ReferencedSOPInstanceUID) should be used.
* Read the referenced UID from the RTSS object
* Determine the file name from the UID (using the Slicer DICOM database)
* Load the file, get the slice thickness
* Use that as the width of the ribbon

If reading the thickness from each slice takes too long time then we may just read one slice and assume that all the slices have the same thickness. But then we should add this limitation to the wiki.

It's important to get not only the slice thickness but the slice orientation from the image file.

If there are any assumptions (all slices have the same thickness, all slices have the same orientation, etc.) then please add them to the 'Known limitations' section in SlicerRt_users_guide. If possible, implement checking for the assumptions and warn the user if something may go wrong.

## #50 Selection of the loadables is not deterministic
In DICOMWidgets.py/DICOMLoadableTable::addLoadableRow function leaves a loadable item selected when it was examined by the first specialized DICOM plugin that can read it.
However, the order of the plugins is not deterministic, so we cannot tell which loadable item of the same series is selected until we know the order the plugins have been loaded by Slicer.

## #51 Use the correct DICOM reader plugin when reloading a saved scene
Currently always the scalar image DICOM reader is used for loading the DICOM objects when a saved scenre is reloaded. This behavior causes problems, e.g., we load structure sets from an RTSS file, then save the scene, then when we load the scene the scalar image reader cannot interpret the RTSS file and it returns an error and it doesn't load the structures. 

We need to keep track of which DICOM importer was chosen by the user to load a particular DICOM object, and use that same importer when later the scene is saved and reloaded. It could be stored as MRML node attributes.


#### 2012-02-18, 17:27:53 - Andras Lasso
description: changed from "Currently always the scalar..." to "Currently always the scalar..."

#### 2012-02-18, 18:48:56 - pieper
If the plugin in really an importer, then it should be creating native slicer data types that have storage nodes with the ability to read/write the slicer format and preserve whatever information is needed to process them in slicer.  For example, the diffusion dicom importer converts the files to nrrd dwi, which are then managed by slicer.  The same is true for scalar volumes.

However if we need to go back to the dicom files at every scene load, then we should think about making storage nodes that would let the scene work with the dicom files natively.

But aren't we more in the importing mode?  Which cases aren't imports?


#### 2012-02-20, 22:45:00 - Andras Lasso
This is a very good point. We should not go back to the DICOM files once they are loaded into Slicer. We just import the data from DICOM and then we should treat them as native Slicer data types.

So, we just need to change the implementation to save the data using native Slicer data storage nodes. Now the only problematic data type is dose map, as currently it still uses the DICOM storage node. Probably if we just change the node's ModifiedSinceRead attribute to true and then it would be saved in a new file and it would be reloaded correctly from that file.


#### 2012-02-20, 22:53:49 - Andras Lasso
There is still one design question related to this: how shall we store additional metadata with the imported objects? E.g., we need to store the dose unit ('Gy') and reference dose value (a floating-point value that defines a multiplier to convert between the voxel values and the physical unit value) with the dose map (that is basically a scalar volume).
I see these options:
* A. Store these additional information as MRML node attributes. Pro: very simple, node type is not changed, so all Slicer modules can operate on the data. Con: are the node attributes are preserved when the node is processed by a CLI or other modules? if the volume is edited then the attributes may need to be updated as well
* B. Create a new MRML custom node type. Pro: any custom data can be stored in the node; proper, typesafe get/set methods and custom storage and display nodes can be developed. Con: need to develop custom modules for edit/display/storage; existing modules may not recognize the custom data type.
* C. Create a new MRML node that stores a pointer to the basic Slicer node (e.g., scalar volume) and stores the custom attributes. Pro: modules can still operate on the basic Slicer node, no additional information may be lost. Con: need to develop custom modules for edit/display/storage; when the basic node is processed/duplicated then it will be not associated with the custom MRML node, so a new one may need to be created and associated manually.


#### 2012-02-21, 02:23:20 - pieper
Yes, agreed on those options - the problem of passing along the data across processing steps is an interesting one.  It would be helpful (to me at least) to sketch out some of the processing workflows and think what data is needed at each point.  In some cases it might make sense to explicitly select a study for output data to be associated with (this is the approach for exporting non-dicom data into dicom files).  In other cases it might make more sense to have slicer maintain information about the provenance information and the infer the metadata when it comes time to re-export the data to dicom.

As a point of reference, for annotations we're planning to have annotations know the volume that was shown when they were created, and the volumes know the instance IDs of the slices in the volume.  From that we plan to have the needed information to export SR/AIM documents.

Creating custom mrml nodes is possible, but it won't really solve the data propagation issues unless we touch all the modules...

#### 2012-03-02, 16:02:20 - Andras Lasso
(In revision:51) Fixed #55: Set ModifiedSinceRead attribute to true to force saving the imported RTDOSE volume (thus, it will not be imported again from DICOM). Additional data (dose unit and scaling factor) is saved as custom MRML node attributes.

## #55 Export RT data from Slicer in DICOM-RT format
It's important to be able to save deformed contours, dose maps, etc. in DICOM-RT format.
Slicer topic branch: https://github.com/cpinter/Slicer/tree/srt55-dicom-export
SlicerRT branch: https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/branches/DICOMExport/

Plan:
1. The export operation can be started from two places: the now disabled Export button in the DICOM browser, and from subject hierarchy (a button below the tree and/or from the context menu of exportable node (explained a bit later) – this would pre-select the node to export)

2. When initiating export by any of the actions, a DICOM export window pops up containing the following
    A) Radio button to choose between individual series export (default), and entire scene export as a secondary capture containing the MRB. If entire scene is selected, then B, C and D are hidden
    B) Slightly modified subject hierarchy tree (determined by a flag in the SH model)
        - Only the exportable nodes show up (i.e. nodes that have at least one DICOM plugin that returns a confidence value on exporting greater than zero - this decision should be very quick, as the plugins are given nodes, and they don't have to deal with the DICOM DB or files, so it can be expected not to slow down the tree operations)
        - Icons indicate if the mandatory tags are present (easy to do for patients and studies – probably already helps a lot – but can be extended, see below)
        - Multi-select to choose more nodes if they are to be exported together (DICOM plugin has to be able to handle multiple nodes of certain types for this, e.g. RT plugin can handle CT + RTSS + RTDOSE and can create connections between the series, but scalar volume plugin can only handle multiple volumes which it exports one by one without creating connections)
    C) A modified DICOM tag editor (DICOM browser -> Metadata) that allows editing the fields
    D) Actions for populating tags from another SH node, or from a DICOM series in the database (comments * and ** in the image)
    E) Export row with export button and a directory selector

3. When export is clicked (for single series case, the entire scene case is straightforward), then
    A) DICOM plugins are given the series subject hierarchy node to export. They return confidence numbers (0 to 1) indicating how suitable they think themselves for exporting the node in question
    B) List of suitable plugins is shown with highest confidence on top and selected
    C) User makes selection
    D) Series is exported by the chosen plugin. The patient and study tags are pulled from parent SH nodes. If there is a mandatory tag missing, then the plugin returns with an error and the list of missing tags. The user can then edit the tags until all mandatory is present and click Export again.

4. Two possibilities to handle mandatory tags in series: 1) popup error message when Export is clicked telling the user what mandatory tags are still required (easier implementation); 2) real-time feedback in the modified tree (2B) and red rows with the missing tags in the editor (for this pre-selection of the exporter plugin is necessary, which differs from 3A; this could be implemented as a second round after making it work with option 1)

Re #55: DICOM-RT import works again by passing the loadable information one by one

Thanks, Jc, I'll try!

#### 2014-10-31, 18:01:02 - Andras Lasso
It is a completely fine solution if you define a VTK class for storing all data exchange between the plugin and the framework. This is what the vtkDICOMImportInfo class already does for import. vtkDICOMImportInfo was not put into the DICOM import framework because the import was already implemented in Python, but with the new unified import/export framework, implemented in C++, we can finally make vtkDICOMImportInfo a first-class citizen. We can either extend vtkDICOMImportInfo to handle both import and export (if there are many common members) or create a new similar class for export.

#### 2014-10-31, 23:31:39 - Csaba Pinter
I'd like to avoid the long conversion code from Qt to VTK. I also want to keep the Qt classes, as it is so elegant to use the exact same code for the python and Qt/C++ classes. I thought about re-instating the import info class, but with a single conversion call, which does not work if we do it by calling a copy method in the VTK class with the Qt class. But, as Jc suggested that it would work, maybe we could have a method for that in the Qt container classes. How about:
* Two new VTK classes in DICOMLib/Logic, one for the loadable and the other for the exportable (vtkSlicerDICOMLoadable, vtkSlicerDICOMExportable)
* A conversion method to each Qt container class, qSlicerDICOMLoadable::convertToVtkLoadable and qSlicerDICOMExportable::convertToVtkExportable
? That way we can convert to VTK in one line.

Re #55: Fix RT export examine; Loaded RT structure set are not placed in subject hierarchy as a child of the referenced anatomical volume, but under the study, to ensure consistency, as this parenting cannot be done manually by the user according to parenting rules
Commit: r:1998|slicerrt:1998

#### 2014-11-01, 13:26:48 - Andras Lasso
Logic and MRML cannot use Qt and in general I would somewhat prefer if import/export could be performed using only C++ Logic & MRML classes when doing batch processing. So, I would tend to favor solutions that allow this and that keep Qt at the application and GUI level. On the other hand, Qt allows higher level abstraction and simpler code, so I see that it has advantages to use Qt as much as possible. It's hard to define where is the optimal division between Qt and non-Qt, so maybe the best would be to discuss this next week in person/Skype.


#### 2014-11-01, 13:50:40 - Csaba Pinter
With the current DICOM infrastructure it would not be possible to do everything in VTK/MRML/C++, because of the python core. As I see absolutely no chance for that to change, I rather went for accommodating that with the Qt container that is better python-wrapped and easier to use (through Qt properties). I know this is quite heterogenious, but I think it is not a bad way to make do with the tools we have (I'll show you the code).

#### 2014-11-01, 13:51:23 - Csaba Pinter
I'll go ahead with implementing the VTK containers, because those are needed in any case as far as I see.

## #56 Compute dose accumulation
The 'Add scalar volumes' can already add two volumes, but dose maps can have special properties, such as measurment units, normalization factor, etc. It could be better to have a specialized module that takes into account all these special properties.

(In r:244|slicerrt:244) re #57: Added superbuild option that downloads and builds Plastimatch core as static lib and uses it in SlicerRt. Can be enabled with the SLICERRT_SUPERBUILD option (does not work yet as is, because there are a few issues with Plastimatch CMake files)

Plastimatch issues:
* Unnecessary #include 'plmreconstruct_config.h' in 3 files (proj_matrix.cxx, proj_image_dir.cxx, proj_image.cxx) cause build errors => remove the include line
* If Slicer is found then it is assumed that we want to build Plastimatch Slicer modules (and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is forced to ON and copying of DLLs to certain Slicer directories is forced). Need a separate switch for SLICER_FOUND and for building slicer modules (such as PLM_BUILD_SLICER_MODULES). Only PLM_BUILD_SLICER_MODULES should enable shared lib and building and installing of Plastimatch Slicer modules. PLM_BUILD_SLICER_MODULES should be turned off if the PLM_CONFIG_LIBRARY_BUILD option is ON.
* In FindDCMTK.cmake a couple of find_library calls are incorrect: the PATHS keyword is missing after the library name (e.g., find_library (DCMTK_dcmimgle_LIBRARY dcmimgle  ${DCMTK_DIR}/dcmimgle/libsrc …) => find_library (DCMTK_dcmimgle_LIBRARY dcmimgle  PATHS ${DCMTK_DIR}/dcmimgle/libsrc …)

What is still missing:
* conversion of the structure volumes to cc
* make sure that non-1 foreground labelmap values don't affect the total mass metric
* decide how the T+, T-, F+, F- voxel numbers are displayed (% would better perhaps)
* make sure it can handle labelmaps generated using different reference volumes (different origin, orientation etc)
* how center metrics are interpreted? in which cooridnate system should we display those?
* perhaps it would be good to move the ITK->VTK image conversion to SlicerRtCommon, although they (the other one is in DoseComparison) work slightly differently

## #61 Export RT data to Matlab
Several groups (such as Dionne M. Aleman, UofT; John Schreiner et al. at the cancer center in KGH) use Matlab for algorithm development. Therefore, it's important to be able to export DICOM-RT data in a file format that can be conveniently loaded into Matlab. Then the processing results should be possible to load into Slicer for analysis.

First just implement saving RT data in a format that can be read in Matlab.

Provide sample scripts that export data from Slicer to file.
Provide sample scripts that import data from file to Matlab.

Data representation in Matlab is a non-trivial question.
Many current Matlab-using RT researchers are familiar with CERR data representation. So, it seems to be a good idea to read from file into a CERR-like data representation.

Now dose and CT data can be sent as volume, structure sets as labelmaps, so I think we can consider this to be done.

## #63 Make the Model to labelmap module work for non-axis-aligned reference volumes
Currently the direction cosines in the reference volume are ignored. The generated labelmap is correct, but the labelmap covers a slightly different region than the reference volume.

Probably the simplest would be to run the labelmap generation in the IJK space (for this the contours should be converted form the RAS space to the IJK space).

If the volume axes are not aligned with the RAS axes, then sometimes the model to labelmap generation with the stencil method gives a result that has holes in it (screenshot attached).
Probably when Kevin manages the setting of the ribbon thicknesses according to the actual slice thickness, this issue will be fixed. Testing needed when ticket #49 is done.

## #65 Make SlicerRt extensions downloadable for standard 3DSlicer releases
Currently a special private build of SlicerRt has to be used, as the DCMTK version that Slicer uses now does not support RT objects.
Once 3DSlicer starts to use a more recent DCMTK version, the SlicerRt extensions can be published as extensions.

Automatic tests are required for the downloadable extensions.

## #66 Display real dose values
Currently when a dose map is loaded the raw voxel values are displayed. The users would be interested in the actual dose values (voxelValue*DoseGridScaling) and the unit (Dose Units). The DoseGridScaling and DoseUnit values are stored as custom MRML node attributes in the dose map volume.

Possible implementation options:
*A: update the Data probe widget to use the intensity scaling and unit parameters (if they are defined for the selected volume). Probably update the volumes module as well to reflect the scaling value in the histogram, maybe add the possibility to view/edit the intensity scaling&unit. Somewhat not nice is that probably the scaling&unit info will be lost when the volume is processed.
*B:  convert the dose map to float image when importing the dose map: it requires 2x more memory (float instead of short) and the unit is still not displayed

Option A seems to be the better option, as it's not too big change and the feature would be useful in general (not just for RT).
The list of attributes name&values should be visible (and maybe editable) for the user. Maybe in the data module.

UPDATE: After further consideration we decided to implement Option B. The memory impact is not that painful as usually dose volumes are not very big and on a 64 bit environment the system should be able to handle the extra data. Also driving the changes trhough all the affected modules is complicated as the extra fields would have to be used in virtually every module that handles volumes, and these changes needs to be checked with the responsible people.
UPDATE 2: It turned out that both the unsigned int and the float data type is 32 bits, so the volumes are of the same size in memory

## #67 Store computed DVH in MRML node
Store computed DVH in MRML node to avoid recomputation for plotting/statistics computation. Also, now when the scene is closed all the MRML nodes are deleted, but the DVH metrics in the DVH module are still shown (becuase they don't refer to MRML nodes). Note that for charting the values are already stored in a MRML node, so maybe that can be utilized.

There could be a list of computed DVHs in the DVH module. Each line could contain an eye icon (that could turn on/off the visibility of a DVH in the currently selected plot) and a number of DVH metric values.

Dose unit should be stored and displayed for each DVH (currently it is shown in the table header, but it's not good, as the unit in DVHs may differ)

## #70 Visualize deformation fields in Slicer
Visualization and/or export (for visualization in ParaView) is needed.

Question from the Slicer users mailing list: In Slicer3D, is there a way to get the deformation grid and displacement vector that represents the Bspline deformation between 2 3D images? Do you know how to do display this in Slicer3D? I have registered a lung CT-sim (planning) image with the conebeam CT (pre-treatment) image of the same patient and obviously, there are a few deformations involved. These are described using the Bspline parameters. However, the tfm file has a bunch of numbers that is difficult to interpret. Can you help me displaying the deformation using either a deformation grid or displacement vector field (with bunch of arrows) or both?

Answer: We have some rudimentary (commandline) tools to convert to a deformation field. You will find details here: http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Slicer-3-6-FAQ#How_can_I_convert_a_BSpline_transform_into_a_deformation_field.3F Visualization can be done by loading the deformation field as a 4D volume which displays direction as color orientation, although of limited use because negative numbers are clipped. You can also try applying your transform to aux. grid images available here: http://na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Projects:RegistrationDocumentation:UseCaseInventory:Auxiliary

Thanks, nice improvements! See the updated list of remaining bugs and features below.

Priority: (H)igh, (M)edium, (L)ow

Fixes:
* (H) Make sure that default values results in good visualization:
** Default grid density is too dense; unit is missing (should be in mm)
** Rename Scale X, Y, Z to Length and Radius (setting Y and Z separately is not needed)
** Arrow Glyph Tip length should be constrained between 0% and 100%
** Arrow Glyph Tip Radius meaning should be clarified in tooltip, maybe changed to % 
** Arrow merge Tip & Shaft resolution into one 'Resolution' and set the range minimum to 6
** Sphere no need to specify radius (you can set it with the Scaling parameter)
** Sphere two resolution fields into one 'Resolution' and set the range minimum to 6
** Sphere glyph no need for several scale factors, keep only one (and isotropic scaling)
** Contour: default minimum and maximum values are mismatched (maximum is 0, minimum is 6)
* (H) Contour surface colors are strange (each contour should have a uniform color)
* (M) Move Number of Glyphs and Magnitude threshold parameters to the top
* (M) Add tooltips
* (M) Grid is not closed on one side
* (M) Rename 'Seed' parameter to 'Random seed' and move it to the bottom (users will modify other parameters more frequently)
* (L) Make sphere glyph non-directional

Features:
* (H) Allow using a Transform node (any kind of transform node, linear, non-linear, ...) as input
* (H) Add visualization capabilities for images slices:
** Glyph extension to 2D: extruded simple arrow (with ribbon filter?)
** Ribbon grid (centered on each slice), selectable plane normal
* (M) Nicer icons (module icon and visualization option icons)
* (M) Add a hard threshold on the minimum deformation (nothing below that level is visualized)

The actual values (1mm, 3mm, 5mm) may be hardcoded, optionally should be possible to set manually (it may be enough if you can do it in the color module), and may be also computed automatically.
* (L) Make the Visualize button disabled and explain why it's disabled (in the tooltip or in warning message next to the button) if no Output Model is selected

To be discussed:
* I think scale factor does not make sense in: Grid, Block, 2D Grid (only when we project the deformation into another dimension, but with these 3D objects there is no additional dimension to extrude to), maybe just an enable/disable deformation (0 and 1 scaling factor) to allow deformation&color or just color
* Why the 2D arrow glyph is useful?

Very good Franklin. Once the fixes and high-priority features are ready we'll move this into the SlicerRT extension.

As a preparation for the integration, please build the SlicerRT extension on your computer (as described here: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/wiki/SlicerRt_developers_page).

#### 2013-03-28, 18:45:44 - Andras Lasso
Very nice work Franklin!

Add support for 'Reformat' orientation for Grid Image Slice option? => No, just having a node selector is enough. You can change the orientation of a slice viewer any time using the Reformat module (or reformat widget).

To do:
* [H] Test transform node input (actually it crashes now: load MRHead sample data and use them as reference image, create a simple linear transform and use as deformation field, then click Visualize)
* [H] Fix spacing of 2D visualizations: arrow and grid ribbons should be all organized into slices; slice positions and thickness should be retrieved from the slice viewer (use the current slice position as the center of the ribbon and use the slice viewer spacing as the width of the ribbon)
* [M] Change the slice selector to a standard node selector (same way as in the Reformat module)
* [M] Change the color map to have 4 labels: negligible (0mm by default): transparent; low (1mm by default): green; medium (3mm by default): yellow; high (5mm by default): red. The actual values (1mm, 3mm, 5mm) may be hardcoded, optionally should be possible to set manually (it may be enough if you can do it in the color module), and may be also computed automatically.

I think the module is ready to be moved to the SlicerRT extension (as an experimental module for now, until the [H]igh priority todos are completed).

@pinter would do the integration (basically simply move the module under the SlicerRT extension directory and update the CMakeLists.txt), so let him know when you committed all your pending changes, then he would move the code, and he'll tell you when it's ready. After that you'll have to check out and build the SlicerRT extension that'll include your module.

## #71 Make the DVH computation and display work for non-dose volumes as well
Currently any type of volume can be chosen for DVH computation (it's then an 'intensity volume histogram'). The problem is that the user may not know that it's not a correct DVH, so some warning message should be displayed. Also, the fixed (0.0, 100%) point should not be inserted if there are negative values in the volume (as it appears as a peak in the plot, see attached).

This is an extremely useful feature! Two things to be improved:
* automatic update: currently the fields are not updated when the MRML node is changed (e.g., open the node inspector for a non-label volume => it will show LabelMap=0; change the volume type to labelmap in the Volumes module; open the node inspector => it will still show LabelMap=0; if you switch to another node and then switch back then the attributes are updated => it will still show LabelMap=1 -- it should observe the model and update the attribute names and values whenever the node changes)
* editing: curently you can edit the attribute names and values, which is really cool; however, unfortunately it seems that the changes are not actually saved; it would be great if you could actually save the changed attribute into the node (or if it is not possible then make the widget read-only)


#### 2012-04-13, 14:27:06 - Csaba Pinter
Oh right, I forgot to set them read-only. Should I do that or save the edited attribute in the MRML node?

Some hints should be given to the user about the mapping from (1) (2) ... to solid, dashed, ...

If there are multiple line styles then we could just add it as a string, e.g.:
[  ] solid: BRAIN (1)
[  ] dashed: BRAIN (2)
[  ] dotted: BRAIN (3)
[  ] dash-dot: BRAIN (4)

And a feature request should be submitted for a long-term solution (where not only the color but the line style is shown in the legend). Unfortunately, jqPlot can only show the color swatch and doesn't show the line style in the legend, so either heavy customization of jqPlot is needed (probably feasible) or a different plotting toolkit should be used.

## #78 Display a warning if not a dose volume is chosen as Dose Volume
Multiple people have reported that DVH module did not work correctly, while they just computed the DVH for the CT volume. Today I did the same mistake myself.

Possible options for helping the user to avoid this mistake:
* display a warning message (next to the compute DVH button?) if a non-dose volume is selected
* by default display only dose volumes in the Dose Volume node list  (there could be an advanced option to show all volumes in the node list)

#### 2012-04-11, 15:57:34 - Csaba Pinter
Check DoseUnit attribute and consider the volume dose volume if it is present.
Also we can remove the DoseGridScaling attribute as it is already applied and it can be misleading to have a value there that is not 1 (and having 1 there does not make much sense)

Hello,

I am the project lead for dicompyler. I just received the Scitation TOC Alert today for the upcoming issue of Medical Physics and noticed your paper has been published. Congratulations and thank you for your reference to dicompyler in the paper.

I was wondering if there is there any way for you to correct your reference for dicompyler from the website to the AAPM canonical reference: available here: http://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1118/1.3468652

The bibtex entry is as follows:

{% raw %}
~~~~~
@ARTICLE{Panchal2010,
   author = {{Panchal}, A. and {Keyes}, R.},
    title = '{SU-GG-T-260: Dicompyler: An Open Source Radiation Therapy Research Platform with a Plugin Architecture}',
  journal = {Medical Physics},
     year = 2010,
   volume = 37,
    pages = {3245},
      doi = {10.1118/1.3468652},
}
~~~~~
{% endraw %}

Thanks,

Adit

Hi Adit,

Thank you for your kind words!

The paper has passed the proofing process, but I can try to push your paper reference.
Sorry for not citing your article in the first place, I didn't find it at the time.

Hi Adit,

I asked the editorial staff if they can change it either in print or online, but it's already published, so it is unfortunately too late.
Sorry about that!

I don't follow their activity, but I downloaded their source code and according to the logs, there have been only 4 commits since November 2011 (2 from April 2012, one in October and one last month), all minor changes.

So I think we can say that they don't really maintain it.

## #82 DICOM-RT import fails when multiple RT objects are stored in one series
The eclipse-7.3.10-test-suite-aapm-tg119 data set contains multiple RTSS objects in one series. SlicerRt fails to import and load these series.

Problem 1: After importing only the first RTSS is displayed in the patient tree (RTSTRUCT: TG119-Prostate). All the 4 RTSS (CShape, HN, Multi, Prostate) should show up separately or a composite (CShape, HN, Multi, Prostate) or generic name (RTSS: (multiple) ).

Problem 2: In the image list 5 instances are shown, all of them with the same caption (RTSTRUCT: TG119-Prostate). Instead, 4 different RTSS (CShape, HN, Multi, Prostate) should show up.

Problem 3: Regardless of which RTSS object is selected for loading, always the TG-119-Prostate structures are loaded only.

## #87 Investigate dose deposition coefficient map calculation (from CERR).
During the interview with Dionne of UoT, dose deposition coefficient map was requested as a feature useful for her group. Currently they get it from CERR, it would be nice if slicer can generate the map. However she is not familiar with CERR's algorithm on how to compute these maps.

## #88 Talk to RT researchers in Toronto to find a specific application
* Find use case
* Help and implement whatever is necessary for that  use case (dose accumulation, deformation visualization, ...)

There were useful discussions, see details at SlicerRt_developer_meetings_2012

Highlights:
* Use Slicer for deformable registration and dose accumulation
* Use Slicer as a hub for conversion between data formats and comparison (not for dose calculation and other complex computations)
* Platform for algorithm prototyping: Matlab interface, Python samples

## #96 Metadata is not preserved when the image is resampled
When the dose map is resampled then the additional metadata disappears. This is a problem because after a dose map is transformed it's not recognized as a dose map anymore.

Potential DCMTK-based, Slicer4 compliant implementation:
* patient hierarchy tree
* node attributes assigned to tree branches
* CLI interface defines reference and results are put back into the same location as the referenced input
* 'export' loaded data: in the DICOM dialog
* export from patient hierarchy tree could be a shortcut to the export loaded data function in the DICOM dialog

The resampled volume is put in the same subject hierarchy branch as the input dose volume, and so the study-related metadata is accessible for the resampled volume as well. The dose volume identifier attribute of the input dose volume is not propagated, however the RT dose subject hierarchy plugin exposes a convert action that can add this attribute to the resampled volume, preserving all the other medatada.

It would be much better to create a colormap with the colors of the structure sets and use the correct label index for each structure - instead of having one user-defined value (which will not result in correct color anyway). This may seem to be a lot of work, but it will be necessary anyway.

Maybe we should change the label to 'Save labelmaps that are used for DVH computation'.

If we create multiple labelmaps it would be nice to put them under a hierarchy (is it possible to put them in an annotation hierarchy?).

The corresponding Slicer mantis issue is http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2219


## #103 Develop an algorithm for surface generation from contours
Need to preserve the original contour points of the planar contours and produce a closed surface by closing the gap between the planar contours.

The inputs of the algorithm:
* Set of planar contours: For now we can assume that they are drawn on parallel planes. It would be nice to develop an algorithm that in the future can be extended to deal with contours drawn on different plane orientations, but this is not essential, just something to keep in mind.
* Slice thickness: The contours come from manual drawing on image slices. Each image slice has a thickness. Typically the thickness is the same as the distance between the image slices. Thickness info is needed, e.g., when you extrapolate the surface before the first and after the last contour; also when you need to decide if two contours should be connected by a surface or they belong to two different surface meshes.

The end result should be a VTK-based C++ algorithm implementation, automatic tests for validating it on a number of data sets, integrated into the open-source SlicerRT platform (we would do this integration), published in a journal or conference proceedings.

I would suggest to study the http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkVoxelContoursToSurfaceFilter.html filter and reuse its main structure and interface and replace the internal algorithm implementation.

A promising algorithm that could be used: https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/nodes/trunk/SlicerRt/doc/references/Wang2005.pdf

Sample data sets (5 data sets, each of them containing multiple contours) are available in the attached zip file. You can view the contours, images, surfaces in ParaView.

We don’t want an algorithm that changes the original contour points, so any algorithm that is based on sampling on a rectilinear grid is not usable. For example, the ContoursToSurface example in VTK (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/PolyData/ContoursToSurface) uses the vtkVoxelContoursToSurfaceFilter, which creates the surface points by creating an image volume and extract the surface using a contour filter. If you choose to create a high-resolution volume then you get pretty similar contours to the original, but it requires lots of memory, computation time, and the surface will have too many points. If you use a lower-resolution volume then the generated surface will not follow closely the original contours.

There are methods that use the image contents, but we would prefer to not use the image contents for now. The only additional input to the contour sets is the slice spacing, which is essentially the thickness of the contour (two contours should not be connected with a surface if they are not drawn on neighbour slices).

---
A problem that Kyle was trying to solve is the issue of 'wings' on certain cases where there are big changes between adjacent slices. The problem is not trivial, so we don't have a fix yet. However it is *needed to investigate how these wings are rasterized and what effect they have on the computed DVH* (ribbon -> labelmap VS winged surface -> labelmap)
For test input, see attached optLPTV56b_P_Contour_Original_Contour.vtk and optLPTV56b_P_Contour_Interpolated_Mesh.vtk

---
Tasks to complete:
* Port algorithm to C++
* Test self-intersecting contours - the goal here is not necessarily to create a nice-looking surface, but to make sure the rasterized labelmap is valid (similarly to the other difficult cases where it is very hard to achieve a qualitatively good surface, the point is just to make sure the algorithm does not fail and the output is usable)

It'll be implemented as a VTK filter. First just put it in the sandbox and build and test separately from Slicer.

Example for a standalone VTK project: VTK / Examples / Build / vtkLocal / (http://vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTK.git;a=tree;f=Examples/Build/vtkLocal;h=4f4d7587c8aab5228f16414ee4209da33d757783;hb=refs/heads/master)

#### 2013-03-07, 23:39:56 - Andras Lasso
Thank for the update. A few suggestions:
* Please always refer to the ticket number in the commit comment in the following format:    re #103: Changed this and that
* I’ve created a data directory and copied all the sample data there. For now you can keep and use the ply files (just move them into the data subdirectory), but note that the PLY files don’t contain the line information, just the points. The only reliable way to identify which point is in which contour is to read it from a file that contains this info. The original VTP files contain this info and using Paraview you can convert to VTK format that can be read into Matlab (e.g., http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph/content/toolbox_graph/read_vtk.m)
* Remove all hardcoded references to specific filenames from functions (e.g., [vertex, face] = read_ply('femoral head rt.ply');), because functions are meant to be reusable. To test the functions create simple m scripts that contain references to specific file names and call the functions.

Hi Andras,

A problem with the interpolation now is that I cannot distinguish between contours in the same z plane (which, as you mentioned, is a problem with the .ply format).  Unfortunately the read_vtk function isn't reading the VTK files that Paraview is producing.  The error I'm getting is:

Warning: Problem in reading vertices. 
> In read_vtk at 38

vertex =

   Empty matrix: 3-by-0


face =

     0

Do you know of any other VTK reading functions or VTP to VTK conversion methods?  Or any other way to distinguish contours in general?

Thanks, 
Tom.

You can run the interpolation by executing the function testInterp().  The algorithm is not perfect and this can be seen most obviously in the brain contour example.  The algorithm naively triangulates all contours that lie in the nearest z-plane and so when multiple contours lie in one plane some extraneous edges appear.

It is not nice that some methods break when contour planes normals are not aligned to Z axis, but it may be acceptable if it simplifies the implementation a lot.

However, at least it has to be documented very clearly which methods require this kind of 'normalized' input.

Since there are only 2 functions (that I know of) that require the contour normals are aligned, it may be worthwhile to rewrite those methods to be orientation agnostic.
For now though, I have left a note in the header file for each function.

## #104 Integrate fixes into CTK master
All of our changes are in a github fork of CTK: git@github.com:SlicerRt/CTK.git

Modified files:
•  DCMTK.cmake: no need to merge, our version it’s just contains a DCMTK version with DCMRT
•  ctkDICOMDatabase.cpp, h:
o  Added a runQuery method that allows execution of any database queries. Currently we only use it to get filename from the SOPInstanceUID (SELECT Filename FROM Images WHERE SOPInstanceUID=”…”), so we could add a QStringList ctkDICOMDatabase::filesForSOPInstanceUID(QString seriesUID) method instead, but runQuery seemed more versatile (if we add filesForSOPInstanceUID then we may need to add more methods later for different queries; if we have runQuery then most probably we won’t need any other methods later).
o  Fixed bug: additional check added in loadFileHeader to prevent crashes
o  Added modality name to the series description: modality (CT, MR, …) information is absolutely essential; it should either appear in the series description or in a separate column
o  Changed date/time reading for RTSTRUCT, RTPLAN, RTDOSE items: these IODs don’t use the common seriesDate and seriesTime tags
o  Fixed bug: patientsBirthDate formatting
o  Changed the study description heuristics: the old implementation just used the tags that were found in the first DICOM file; however, the tags are often empty in some files but filled in others. The modified implementation always updates the fields, which is not very good in term of performance and also not fully correct, because it basically uses the last non-empty value. I think the best would be to store the study information at the series or images level (because this information is actually specified in each file). Optionally we could compute consolidated values (e.g., merge all the modalities, institution names, physicians, descriptions from the images that are in that study) and store it at the study level.
o  Use contentDate if seriesDate is not defined
o  Fixed bug: formatting of seriesDate and seriesTime 
•  ctkDICOMDataset.cpp:
o  Fixed bug: maxReadLength parameter usage in ctkDICOMDataset::InitializeFromFile
•  ctkDICOMModel.cpp
o  Fixed bug: ReferringPhysician was used as Institution name
o  Added display of “No description” string in case the Name column is empty (otherwise the tree looks corrupted)
•  ctkDICOMAppWidget.ui: small size adjustment of the widgets, probably not needed anymore
•  FindDCMTK.cmake: additional include and library paths are added for DCMRT 

The only part I’m not sure about is the study description heuristics. Probably it would be better to completely rework that part instead of merging the current SlicerRT implementation.

All fixes have been integrated (see the latest fixes in https://github.com/commontk/CTK/issues/215).

The only missing part is the customization of fields for different image types (e.g., some IODs use different fields for storing series description).

## #105 Integrate DICOM import fixes into Slicer trunk
We’ve modified 3 DICOM loading related files in SlicerRT (git@github.com:SlicerRt/Slicer.git). 

DICOMWidgets.py
•  if any custom loader recognizes an item then uncheck the item provided by the default “Scalar Volume” loader plugin and move it to the end of the loadable list
•  have a “Reader” column in the loadable list that tells the user plugin provides the item
DICOMScalarVolumePlugin.py
•  prevent recognizing a DICOM file without pixel data as a valid “Scalar Volume” item (because the loading would fail anyway and we would get an error message)
•  show the first file in the tooltip
DICOMPlugin.py
•  there is a small bug when initializing class members

## #107 Fix Jc's code review findings
1) Could you move the Data folder outside of the Testing folder ?

2) line 59 of qSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleWidget.cxx, you are using std::map and std::pair to keep track of QCheckBox and other information (see ChartCheckboxToStructureSetNameMap). You could probably use a QSignalMapper instead. Using QHash, QPair etc .. could also make manipulation easier. I would recommend not to mix style .. Qt container with Qt object. You could then leverage the 'foreach' macro that would simplify your code.

3) Warnings in qSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModule.ui
Generating ui_qSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModule.h
/home/jchris/Projects/DoseVolumeHistogram/Resources/UI/qSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModule.ui: Warning: Z-order assignment: '' is not a valid widget.

I tried it, and it works.

If you don't mind I commited a fix to set the threshold just when loading with the DicomRtImport module.
Can you make the dose volumes table wider just as you did with the Isodose module widget?

I think you can close this after doing the table thing (I know it doesn't fit in this ticket but it is a very small issue, I wouldn't create a ticket just for that).

In the module description page on the Slicer wiki we should copy the same information as in the .h file, with additional details about how this algorithm applied in the module (e.g., oversampling with a 2.0 factor by default).

Andras,

Please check the entry in the Extensions-Continuous track on the Slicer4 url:http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=Slicer4|dashboard that was submitted half an hour ago and close this issue if you think this is good enough.

Yesterday I learned about the 'track' parameter that can be set to CTest, and took the simplest approach to have it appear in the right one. Now the test doesn't use CMake scripts of any sort.

#### 2012-09-26, 23:37:20 - Andras Lasso
There are a couple of limitations:
* Test results are not visible
* The build name does not contain the SVN revision
* The update log (Update Command: '/usr/bin/cmake' '-P' '/home/perklab/Devel/Scripts/Perklab-Virtualbox_Linux-64bits_SlicerRt_Release_Continuous.cmake-origin-master-continuous-gitupdate.cmake') is a bit strange on http://slicer.cdash.org/buildSummary.php?buildid=40315. It's not a git repo.

None of these are blocking issues, so if we wait for 1-2 days and the continuous tests are run correctly then we can close this.

It would be useful if you could add the script/config file/command-line parameters that you use to the developer's page.

#### 2012-09-27, 00:53:03 - Csaba Pinter
According to JC's remarks, I'll use a simple cmake script for the test after all. Probably all of your comments can be addressed with it. I'll set it up tomorrow.

I created the script and the continuous build seems to work with it (I attached the script files as attachment to the ticket).

The only issue I have now is that after restarting the virtual machine, one Plastimatch checkout has to be made so that the authentication is saved and the script can check it out without problems.

If the test works for a couple of days as intended, I'll close the ticket.

#### 2012-10-01, 19:15:51 - Greg Sharp

Fix all build warnings and errors that occur, especially on linux and Mac (we don't test them that often)


#### 2012-08-20, 20:15:05 - Andras Lasso
milestone: changed from "SlicerRt-0.3 release" to "SlicerRt 2012-08"

#### 2012-08-27, 20:15:04 - Csaba Pinter
The warnings have been fixed, but Plastimatch introduced new ones, that have to be fixed before closing this issue.

(In r:450|slicerrt:450) Re #115: Fix two compiler warnings in plastimatch plugins.  There are a couple in plastimatch while building itkClampCastImageFilter.h, which are known to be benign and are not easy to fix.  There are also a few remaining in DVH, isodose, contours, dose comparison.  I can remove them if you want.

#### 2012-11-15, 14:35:09 - Greg Sharp
For remaining build warnings (in SlicerRt proper), here is how I would normally address these.  

(1) comparison of unsigned int with enum => change to int
(2) unused variables => create a macro UNUSED_VARIABLE() which casts to void

This is a matter of taste of course, but ideally these stylistic issues are uniform across the project.  If you like my choices I will proceed.

#### 2012-11-15, 15:31:20 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for taking care of this, Greg!

(2) seems to be good (or just not to declare the variable)

But I don't really understand (1).
Instead of 


~~~~

enum { one = 1, two, three };


~~~~


 you want to declare a bunch of static int variables?
Usually I resolve this by casting the values explicitly, like 


~~~~

if ( representationToConvertTo == (int)vtkMRMLContourNode::RibbonModel )


~~~~


but maybe it's not the best way to do it.

#### 2012-11-15, 16:17:25 - Greg Sharp
For (1) if you have this:


~~~~


enum Foo { a, b, MAX };
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < MAX; i++)


~~~~


You get warning about comparison between unsigned and signed int. So I propose using signed int instead:


~~~~


enum Foo { a, b, MAX };
for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++)


~~~~


For (2), I will proceed, and create a new header file to hold the macro.  The warnings in SlicerRt come from unused formal arguments, or unused Qt d pointer, where it seems stylistically better to keep the unused variable.

#### 2012-11-15, 16:20:23 - Csaba Pinter
I understand now. Thanks!

Thanks for the fixes Greg. Unfortunately, it seems that on some computers there are build errors that may be related: http://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=47429

I'm building the new slicer on my Linux virtual machine to try building SlicerRT (and so Plastimatch). I'll let you know how it went

#### 2012-11-16, 16:23:06 - Greg Sharp
Hi, sorry about that.  I didn't notice that the 'pop' pragma is not supported until gcc version 4.6.  

The build should be now fixed.  However, a few linux build warnings will appear for gcc < 4.6.

The latest version builds on linux, but I get warnings like:

In file included from /home/perklab/Devel/SlicerRT_R64-bin/Plastimatch/src/plastimatch/base/itk_dicom_load.h:8:0,

#### 2012-11-17, 00:16:54 - Greg Sharp
Hmm, not sure what this is.  Probably these pragmas are very sensitive to gcc version.  

I'm going to go back to original code.  There will be a few warnings in ITK included from plastimatch, but I have verified that they are all benign.

Greg, can you please try to fix these?
After that if the Linux build is warning-free we can close the ticket.

Omitting the parameter node is a bad practice. We should not adopt this bad practice but instead fix the bad examples in the Slicer core.
Of course having a parameter node may be lower priority than computing correct results, but it should be implemented at some point.

#### 2014-05-21, 21:39:54 - Csaba Pinter
There is _not a single_ python scripted module that uses parameter set node (I checked this on purpose), this is why I told Kyle not to use that. On the other hand, I'm not sure it is established how one should define and use a parameter set node from python. We can ask the guys in Boston if it's important.

#### 2014-05-22, 01:48:16 - Andras Lasso
if we want to rely on Python-scripted modules then we have to make sure that they have the same quality as loadable and CLI modules. It is essential to be able to save/restore settings and also to be able to use them from C++. Using a parameter node could help in both. Also, parameter nodes are needed for consistency with loadable modules and CLIs.

I agree that it's not trivial to add a parameter node to a Python-scripted module. Probably using a vtkMRMLNode would work. String and numeric values could be stored in attributes. References to nodes could be stored in node references. An attribute could be added for filtering in the node selector.

Indeed, it could be a good idea to discuss this at the project week. For this, it would be nice to have an example, so it would be great if Kyle could give it a try.

#### 2014-05-22, 11:52:26 - pieper
Hi Guys - 

The Editor module uses a parameter node [1] so you could look at that for examples.  Also you can experiment with it - you should be able to set the parameter values from mrml and the gui will update, just like other modules.  So it is definitely possible.

For the Editor things are extra complicated because of the editor effects and the class hierarchy for the logic and gui parts.  But if the goal is simply to serialize the parameter sets for a module and to be able to save and restore them with the scene this is fairly simple to implement, certainly no harder in python than in C++.

Probably we should look at putting a parameter node into the scripted module template and also factoring out as much of the code into a helper class of some kind.

Hi Guys,

I had one question regarding the parameter node used in CLI and loadable modules. I asked this in our hangout meeting but I think I did not make it clear. is it possible to save the parameter node as a single file so it could be loaded into slicer again later? the use case for this is that if I use brainsfit and I found a set of parameters that works for the images I wanted to register, I can save the parameter and later I can use the parameter again in my scripted module or share this parameter with other people. this parameter file could also be stored in a registration case database so people can re-use it. 

I think right now the parameter node can be saved as part of the mrml scene when you save the scene. but that is probably too much info. Maybe this could be a project at the project week?

thanks,

Kevin

Hi Kevin, 

> is it possible to save the parameter node as a single file so it could be loaded into slicer again later?


I am adding Matt McCormick to the discussion, he worked on the parameter serializer (that have been integrated into SlicerExecutionModel) and I think it is something you could either user directly or need to be extended to support this very valid use case.


For more details, see 

  https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerExecutionModel/pull/20


and

> Maybe this could be a project at the project week?


Definitively. In that case, are you planning on working on this ? Would you be up to take on issue 2922 ? :)


> putting a parameter node into the scripted module template [and loadable module template]


Definitively. This is tracked by http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2922


Thanks

Jc

#### 2014-05-22, 16:07:33 - wangk
Hi Jc and Steve,

Thanks for letting me know about the parameter serializer Matt has worked on. I will take a look into that and see if it meets our needs. 

My request is more related to parameter serializer and how to use it in a scripted/loadable module. Issue 2922 is different as it allow scripted/loadable module to have a parameter node. I think Csaba suggested that Kyle (the student) to look into this but I certainly can help at the project week.

Thanks,

Kevin

2. Create CT Series from volume node (need to set UID - it can be anything)
3. Create Structure Set Series
  - Create ColorTable node
4. Create Contour (= ROI Subseries on the DICOM level) from labelmap volume node
  - Create Contour node containing the labelmap node
  - Set Referenced Series UID to CT)
  - Put Contour node under Structure Set Series
  - Add new color to color table
5. Create Contour from Model node

Utility function scripts:
1. Create labelmap volume based on scalar volume (creates vtkImageData and sets it to a vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode)
  - Create volume with identical geometry
  - Fill a region (e.g. cube) using color table index foreground color
2. Create model based on scalar volume (creates vtkPolyData and sets it to a vtkMRMLModelNode)
  - Determine the RAS coordinates of the center of the volume
  - Create a sphere there (use vtkSphereSource)

## #120 Make structure labelmap conversion faster
The rasterization step in DVH computation is quite slow.
It may be possible to speed it up by using extents in the conversion (usually the structures are much smaller than the whole volume, so it may mean a great deal in terms of speed).

#### 2015-05-28, 15:34:32 - Csaba Pinter
Only the effective extent is used when rasterizing in the new segmentations infrastructure. This results in speed and memory usage improvement.

## #121 Display scalar bar for dose map
Need to create a 'fixed' colormap for this to prevent accidental remapping of colors (see http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2425).
It would be nice to also able to display the colormap in the slice viewers.

#### 2012-08-22, 17:21:10 - wangk
I have talked with Young-Bin Cho and he has given me some ideas and a screen capture. I think we need to coordinate the effort for colormap and isodose line module as they are interconnected. basically they want to show isodose at 100%, 95%, 90%, 50% and a couple more in between 90 and 50. they also want to show hot spots (over 100%) at maybe 2 levels. this isodose line scheme will basically dictate how the colormap looks like. 

#### 2013-02-08, 18:06:36 - wangk
This could be partialy achieved now using the current isodose module with scalarbar display. when you import a dose map, go to isodose module, turn on the scalarbar widgets then you have the scalar bar for dose map too. Ideally this should be managed in the colors module but for now it should give you the ability to show scalarbar.

#### 2013-09-06, 18:52:28 - Csaba Pinter
The fixed colormap is used (see ticket #134).

As the color table of each loaded dose volume is created from the default isodose color table, the colors associated to each dose value are the same. We can display scalar bar for the isodose levels (which by default is identical to what can be seen for the dose volume).
The only problem is when someone changes the default isodose color table or does window/leveling then the scalar bar will be invalid. Any ideas for this?

#### 2013-04-01, 12:38:37 - Csaba Pinter
It seems that this task is bigger than just applying some formulas on our data.
My opinion is that a Radiobiological Modeling module is needed that can compute all the proven TCP and NTCP models from the Warkentin2004 article, and contains the default parameter sets. This module would also compute EUD, so that wouldn't be a separate module.

## #125 Implement PatientHierarchy MRML tree
A PatientHierarchy tree (similar to the ModelHierarchy) is needed, so that the loaded DICOM data can be organized into patient/study/series structure.

This tree implicitly stores connections between certain data objects, such as:
* Association between structure models and corresponding labelmaps
* The color table node under the same Series node as the structure models and labelmaps is used to store their color map

Needed actions:
* Create vtkMRMLPatientHierarchyNode class
* Add PatientHierarchy option to the Data module
* Organize objects loaded by the DICOM module under a patient hierarchy
* Utilize the patient hierarchy in the SlicerRT module classes

Idea:
vtkMRMLPatientHierarchyNode is a child of vtkMRMLDisplayableHierarchyNode, and vtkMRMLContourHierarchyNode is child of vtkMRMLPatientHierarchyNode.
This way the Contour node (and all the DICOM-related data, for example if we create vtkMRMLDICOMImageHierarchyNode or similar, which also is a child of the patient hierarchy node) can be displayed in the Data module in Patient hierarchy node. At the same time, the sub-node type objects can be referenced individually by the modules, that need a Contour or DICOM image type as input/output

Talk about this with Steve and the Slicer gurus at the hangout on Nov 20 4PM.
Ask Steve what would be the best approach to arrange the meta data and object connections (e.g. to retrieve all the DICOM tags for a certain node)

#### 2012-11-20, 21:59:11 - Csaba Pinter
Notes from the Slicer hangout:
* Patient hierarchy is a kind of grouping (Personal note: maybe Patient can be a special type of a general Grouping hierarchy?)
* Create and replay pipelines with these hierarchies (graphs)
* Nicole: Hierarchy nodes are not storable
* Reporting: Maintain the link to the instance UID from the source data (hierarchy attribute -> dicom database element)

## #126 DoseComparison Reference dose is zero by default
The 'Reference dose (Gy)' value is set to 0 by default. It is clearly an invalid value but it is not described anywhere what happens if an invalid value is specified (maybe the maximum dose in the dose map is used as reference)?
It would be better to have a radiobutton/checkbox to choose what to use as reference dose: maximum dose or custom value. If custom value is selected then the 'Reference dose (Gy)' editbox should be shown/enabled.

Hi I'd like to start working on this.  Here is my proposal for first stage of development.

1) The first effort considers b-spline registration module only
2a) It should be developed in a separate directory of trunk 
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/Plastimatch
2b) I think this means that plastimatch library gets compiled twice, 
once for SlicerRt, once for Plastimatch.  But I guess that can't be helped.
3) Separate extension in slicer.
4) This one is already loadable, but I do need revise to match Slicer indentation style.

Thank you
-Greg

Would you prefer to
A. create a separate extension for Plastimatch modules (so that the user can download 'SlicerRT' and 'Plastimatch')
B. have all the modules in one extension
?

Option A. would offer somewhat bigger footprint of RT in the Slicer app store and more separation between SlicerRT and Plastimatch.
Option B. has the advantage of being able to share some common infrastructure classes between all the modules, having to maintain only one extension, and building Plastimatch only once (this last one one is really a minor thing). 

I tend to prefer B, as I would rather see more integration between SlicerRT and Plastimatch rather than separation, and B has some additional advantages.

#### 2012-09-19, 23:00:14 - Greg Sharp
Yes, I think B is good.  Sharing infrastructure classes will be convenient, especially structure set processing.  

Therefore, I propose instead this directory.

(In r:296|slicerrt:296) re #131: Added all Plastimatch Slicer modules to SlicerRT (they may be moved to a separate repository if that's preferred).
Disabled modules for now: PlmBspline, PlmLandwarp (requires Plastimatch registration), PlmMabs (requires Plastimatch segmentation), PlmSlicerBspline (need to complete the CMake files update to latest Slicer standard)

#### 2012-09-19, 23:29:48 - Andras Lasso
I've added all the existing Plastimatch Slicer modules to SlicerRT. We can change this if we decide to distribute them in a separate extension.

Most of them already work, the remaining needs some attention (need to check how to export the registration and segmentation classes from Plastimatch; the loadable module makefiles don't follow the latest template yet).


#### 2012-09-20, 01:41:30 - Greg Sharp
Excellent thank you Andras.  I will work on these over the next week or two.

The modules that you disabled (PlmDicomRtExport, PlmDicomRtImport, PlmSynth, PlmXfromwarp) compile and work OK on Windows, with VS2008 compiler. So, you may keep the build enabled for Windows.

## #133 Labelmaps created from the same structures have the same name - scene save issue
When labelmaps created from the same structure have the same name (e.g. from different dose maps), and the scene is saved, then the second labelmap overwrites the first one because Slicer saves them with the same name.

A possible solution would be to use the plot name as the labelmap name (e.g. 'Bladder (2)' and 'Bladder (7) [- -]' instead of 'Bladder').

Commit: r:2547|slicerrt:2547


## #137 Create MRML node that bundles the different contour representations
*1. Create vtkMRMLContourNode* that is a sub-class of vtkMRMLDisplayableNode, thus can be grouped under a vtkMRMLDisplayableHierarchyNode.

It contains references to MRML nodes representing the different data types a contour can have:
* vtkMRMLModelNode for the ribbon representation (DicomRtImport module will load the structure into this object)
* vtkMRMLVolumeNode for the labelmap repesentation
* vtkMRMLModelNode for the model representation (when converting back from labelmap to model)
* vtkMRMLVolumeNode for the labelmap bitmap representation

When a certain representation is requested, then it automatically converts the existing representation into the requested one.
If a representation changes (e.g. labelmap is edited manually), then all the other representations are deleted (and re-converted automatically later when needed)

This node should be in the SlicerRtCommon project. The conversion algorithms should be moved there too.
The proper way to reference to a MRML node from another MRML node is described on the BMC wiki

*2. Create Contours module* that allows handling and editing properties of contour nodes

Properties: default representation (that we want to edit and keep in the scene)

Use cases:
* Loading as ribbon, then DVH computation; the user wants to see the contours in 3D
* Editing contour 1, edit contour 2; see contour 1 while editing contour 2
* Undo/redo

Questions:
* Caching: avoid recompute if switching between multiple representations. Cache different representations? 
* Editing: allow editing of a representation. What happens if one is modified? If we show only one to the user then we don't need to update the other representations immediately.
* How to handle information loss when converting to labelmap?
* How to handle cases when labelmaps are requested at different resolutions (e.g., by different modules). Do we convert from the 'original' or convert from the current representation?
* Preserve an 'original' representation?
* Undo/redo compatibility
* Multiplicity: how to bundle multiple contours for processing/conversion

Decisions:
* Show only one representation in the editor (it's the 'active' representation)
* Caching: if the 'active' representation is modified then invalidate (delete) all the other representations
* Multiplicity: contour hierarchy node (selectable in contour module for changing active representation)

Minor things about the GUI controls in the 'Change active representation' section, I didn't want to enter a new ticket for these:
* 'Active representation' should be changed to 'Convert to' or something similar
* 'Downsampling factor' should be renamed to 'Oversampling factor' (and describe in tooltip text that a value >1 results in sampling on a finer resolution than the reference volume)
* 'Target reduction factor' needs tooltip text that explains this field
* Having a spinbox for 'Downsampling factor' and slider&spinbox for 'Target reduction factor' is somewhat inconsistent. It might be better to use the same kind of control (I prefer the slider&spinbox)
* 'Target reduction factor' two decimals are enough (0.30 instead of 0.333), maybe percentage display would be even more friendly (33%)

## #139 Scalar bar show-hide method is not exposed by the Color module
The Color module in the Slicer core does not expose the scalar bar show-hide method. Need to add it there (and maybe some more functions that allow the selection of a color table as the current table).
Some more improvements would be needed in the color module as well:
* Display the scalar bar in the slice viewers or secondary 3D viewer
* Display labels instead of scalar values (e.g., GenericAnatomyColors labels cannot be displayed)
* Color module crashes if %s is entered in the formatting string
* If the opacity value is changed then the label is overwritten (e.g., 'R=0.000 G=1.000 B=0.000 A=0.800')

Andras,

first of all, there is scalarbar show/hide checkbox in the color module.

to address some issues you listed above, i.e.

* Display labels instead of scalar values (e.g., GenericAnatomyColors labels cannot be displayed)

I have created a slicer ticket  http://na-mic.org/Mantis/view.php?id=2919

I have pushed the topic to github and hopefully Nicole will integrate that into slicer soon.

#### 2013-02-08, 17:57:35 - wangk
I have also update the isodose module to address the issue:

* Display the scalar bar in the slice viewers 

Now scalar bar is shown in both 3D and slice viewers.

The data files look good, except that there are two files which might be the same: EclipseProstate_Dose.nrrd and EclipseProstate_RTDOSE.nrrd. If they are the same, then keep only one, if they are different, then indicate the purpose of the second one in the filename.
One little thing is the color table file names where the dataset name appears both at the beginning and at the end of them (e.g. EclipseEnt_ColorTable_EclipseEnt.ctbl), but it's not a big deal.
Also please make the baseline files' names the same style (basically EclipseProstate_IsodoseBaseline.vtk -> EclipseProstate_Isodose_Baseline.vtk).

However I'd name the scene files like this [FullModuleName]_[DatasetName]_Scene.mrml

Thanks!

It's good that you added this ticket, because I tried to fix it but I couldn't.
I have no idea why they don't match but it would be important that they do.

#### 2012-10-01, 17:10:12 - wangk
Yes. I tried to find the problem once but could not. I will come back to this bug once I am done with isodose and dose accumulation testing code.

#### 2012-10-03, 19:54:10 - wangk
I think I have figured out the problem. If the surface model contains any normal data, it will be used to display in the 2D viewer no matter if the scalars visible checkbox is on or off. That is why when import structure set using dicom-rt import, it is always correct since no normal data will be computed. but in the isodose module, normals are computed and it is used for coloring the isolines. This is more like a slicer core issue and should be reported to slicer bug tracker.

(In r:336|slicerrt:336) Re #142: Fixed the isodose color in 2d viewer. It probably has something to do with the scalar and normals computation. Once I modified the pipeline to generate the polydata, it works fine now. I guess slicer requires certain properties to be properly computed for vtkpolydata in order for the 2D viewer to display the intersection correctly.

## #143 Multiple isodose sets: one for each dose volume
It would be nice to support multiple isodoses, one for each dose volume.  The isodose should be a child node of a dose image.  Then, when you display a dose image, the isodose associated with that dose image gets displayed.  Switching between different doses would show different isodoses.

The tests fail because they crash with a message like this:
'*** glibc detected *** /[long path]/qSlicer...CxxTests: corrupted double-linked list: 0x[address]

Looking further into it, the crash actually happens in
qSlicerLoadableModule::importModulePtyhonExtensions
which is called from qSlicerLoadableModule::setup
which is called from qSlicerAbstractCoreModule::initialize

#### 2013-06-19, 15:06:09 - Csaba Pinter
Further facts:
* If only the PatientHierarchy logic, mrml and qt are wrapped (in importModulePtyhonExtensions), then it does not crash.
* There is no crash if DoseComparison logic is wrapped only
It seems that there is something with the PatientHierarchy module that causes a crash (this is probably not the undeterministic generic test crash though).

## #145 Test DVH D metric computation
I've tested the DVH metric computation and I've found some potential issues in computation of the D metric.
As I understant the D metric should return the dose value corresponding to the specified volume (http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360301603023204-gr5.jpg), however, it does not seem to be the case. Check the DVH of the femoral head in the RANDO^PROSTATE data set. I think for D50% we should get about 25Gy, while 8.4Gy appears in the table.

I've checked a code and didn't find any obvious errors, but I have a few comments:



~~~~


char attributeName[64];
sprintf(attributeName, '%s%s', SlicerRtCommon::DVH_METRIC_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_PREFIX.c_str(), SlicerRtCommon::DVH_METRIC_TOTAL_VOLUME_CC_ATTRIBUTE_NAME.c_str());

~~~~


* Don’t use hardcoded buffer sizes
* Don’t use sprintf ever (use either simple string operator+ or streams; sprintf is obsolete and it would crash if the two strings don't fit in the hardcoded 64 chars)

* In vtkSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleLogic::ComputeDMetrics you may consider using the vtk piecewise linear function. It would simplify the implementation, but I'm not sure about the performance impact.
* Don't use atof, it's really fragile and you don't really know if it failed or not. If no better solution is available in Slicer then copy the StringToInt, StringToDouble, StringToLong functions from PlusCommon.h into SlicerRt common and use that.
* Add automatic tests for dose metric computation (compare our results to some known ground truth)

You're right, the values were strange, I have to check the computation.

I also agree with the other remarks you made.

#### 2012-10-03, 23:58:15 - Andras Lasso
The computed metric value is metric = maximumDose - doseForVolume = 33.4Gy - 24.7Gy = 8.4Gy. It may be correct, but from http://www.jacmp.org/index.php/jacmp/article/view/3068/1740 it seems that the simply metric = doseForVolume.

We should find a reliable definition of the D metric and describe the definition in the tooltip and include a reference to that definition (a paper or book) in the user documentation of the module (we should also describe how we compute the maximum dose value, if we use that value).

@gregsharp, @wangk:
Do you have a good and reliable definition of this D metric?

#### 2012-11-07, 23:06:28 - Greg Sharp
The main idea is like this:

D95 = Dose to 95% of a structure

This means 5% of the structure receives less than D95, and 95% receives more than D95.  (We can assume 0% receives exactly D95.)  I don't know any original reference for this, since it is an old idea.  But maybe this one?

## #150 Make vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter be called more easily
There are two places where vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter is used (DVH and Contours modules), and the calling function is very long in both cases, and also very similar.

It would be good to have a wrapper class that performs that calling, OR the vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter itself augmented so that it handles those issues (downsampling and parent transform handling).

## #151 Remove bitfield labelmap representation from the Contour node
Bitfield labelmap belongs to a set of contours and not just one, so it definitely should not be in the vtkMRMLContourNode.

We made the decision to remove that representation, because
* For the time being we don't plan to implement compressed labelmap representations, only when the need arises
* Apparently the RLE compression makes the labelmaps smaller than the bitfield labelmap (as far as I know the only consideration of the bitfield representation is the shortage of memory in some cases), and also it is closer to the current Slicer object storage philosophy (one object for one structure instead of an object for a group of structures), so we should consider using that if we decide to move in that direction. There is also a chance that we can use vtkImageStencil directly for this purpose, so the workload is probably much smaller.

(In r:374|slicerrt:374) Fixed #151: Bitfield labelmap representation removed from the vtkMRMLContourNode node, because 1: it did not belong there logically (a bitfield labelmap represents more than one contour), and 2: we do not plan to make effort in having a compressed representation for now (and if the need arises then the RLE compression seems to be an easier choice, because it does a better compression and we do not need to introduce a quite new philosophy, namely one node object belonging to multiple contours)

## #152 Conflict of MRML objects with the same name when saving the scene
When loading the same structure set twice, the name of the structure models and color tables are the same. And because the files get the names of the nodes instead of their IDs, there is a conflict, and overwrite is prompted.

## #153 Crash when entering DICOM module on Mac
When SlicerRT is installed.

#### 2012-10-17, 20:00:32 - pieper
I sat down with Ron and he showed me the issue.  Basically the DICOM plugin dies with the stack below and so the load process never completes (the progress dialog remains).

On the slicer DICOM side, I think we should use a try/exception on the plugins in order to be robust.

On the slicer extensions side I think this looks a lot like the previous issue that I had understood was resolved (packaging C++ libraries in mac extensions).

That is a major limitation of our current vtkImageStencil based technique to convert 2D contours (ribbons) to 3D labelmaps. I suggest we should explain this in the help section of the module so that people know about this. and one way to work around this is to always convert to labelmap first then transform later.

Proposed solution: the parameters used to generate the selected representation are set on the GUI (reference volume, downsampling, decimation), and if one of them is changed, then a message appears that conversion is necessary and the current one will be lost.

Hi Csaba,

I think this ticket was created a while ago when we decided to make ROI morphology 2 separate modules. Now that I can add union and intersection and subtraction into the contour morphology module, maybe we do not need this CLI module any more. you can update your code to see the new union and intersection functionality. 

#### 2012-12-10, 16:16:37 - Csaba Pinter
Absolutely.
I moved this ticket to this milestone so that we can mark it as duplicate and invalidate it if everything is included in the contour morphology ticket,
If you feel that this one is completely covered, please create the ticket relation then you can close this.
Thanks!

It turns out that Dice_statistics::run function throws an exception before having the chance to resample the image (line 79 in the cxx). I removed it and I commit if you agree with removing that.

Now it seems to work well, except for the case when both the images are transformed (then the coefficient is 0), I'll investigate it further.

## #160 Improve contour comparison module: compute 95% Hausdorff distance
Compute Hausdorff distance (distance to the closest point on the other surface) for each surface point. The result is a distribution of distances. To make a single number from this distribution that characterizes the segmentation error people usually compute the 95th percentile (the value that is larger than 95% of the computed distance values) of the distance distribution.

#### 2013-02-15, 13:58:37 - Andras Lasso
There is a HD implementation in ITK as well (itkHausdorffDistanceImageFilter), but it can only compute the maximum and average HD and it's not capable of computing the 95th percentile of the HD, which is the usual metric used for registration evaluation.

#### 2013-02-15, 14:07:09 - Andras Lasso
There is a HD implementation in Plastimatch, which is a slightly modified clone of the ITK implementation (it uses the image spacing). The best would be to use this Plastimatch version to compute the max and average HD. Later this class should be further enhanced to compute the 95th percentile of the HD.

#### 2013-02-15, 16:55:35 - Csaba Pinter

See how HD is used in the literature for medical image segmentation evaluation: https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/SlicerRt/doc/references/
Compute HD for set consisting of surface points: Huttenlocher1993, Chalana1997, Klingensmith2000, Gerig2001, Archip2007 (and many many others)
Compute HD for set consisting of all labelmap: Crum2006 (this was the only one that I could find)
So, essentially all papers compute HD for surface points only.

I would recommend to:
* Use the Archip2007 definition for 95% HD
* Maybe compute some average HD as defined in Huttenlocher1993, Chalana1997, Klingensmith2000, Gerig2001
* Remove computation of HD for full labelmap / or if we include it then the implementation shall match exactly Crum2006 (or any other journal reference if you find one)

I'm wondering if we should let the user know that the new labelmap volume has different geometry than the reference volume. It is indeed a special case when the reference volume needs to be expanded to include the contour, but then it can lead to unexpected results, for example when the user wants to use the volume for an operation where matching geometries are expected (such as dice contour comparison). Maybe a simple warning logging in the vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter would be enough.

#### 2013-10-03, 21:44:17 - Csaba Pinter
Another thing is that the body contours (that span every slice in the volume) are always converted with expanded reference volumes, so that their superior and inferior ends could be closed.
Just something to think about...

## #162 Slice viewers are not updated when contour representation is changed
Change from ribbon to closed surface representation => the model is updated correctly in the 3D view, but not in the slice viewers. Probably should be fixed in the Slicer core, so report the error on the Slicer bugtracker and implement a temporary workaround in SlicerRT to force the update.

## #164 Create ContourNode from scratch
Right now one can only get contours by importing a dicom-rt structure set. How about people create the models from scratch in slicer (e.g. manual segmentation) then there is no way to convert them to contours. Maybe we can modify the contour module so that people can specify a closed surface model or labelmap to create a new contour. Once we have DicomRT export, then this can be saved as DICOM.

To be developed:
* Creating blank contour will be possible from the MRML node combobox in Contours node. The user can convert it to a labelmap in Contours module using a suitable reference volume and edit that in Editor
* Drag&dropping a labelmap under a ContourHierarchy in the Patient Hierarchy module will create a new contour node having that labelmap as indexed labelmap representation.
** Color needs to be added to the color table related to the ContourHierarchy
* Probably it's time to create a Logic class for the Contours module to outsource some conversions and computations into that.
* Recolor labelmap based on the new color value (make that as forground value)

Question: what should happen if a model is drag&dropped there? We don't know if it's a ribbon or a closed surface.

## #165 Allow Slicer to pass Segmentation nodes to CLI modules
CLI modules are simpler to implement but the CLI interface does not support all node types. The Slicer core should be enhanced to allow passing of Segmentation nodes.

It could be achieved by supporting hierarchy nodes (or displayable hierarchy nodes) as CLI module input/output in general. Model hierarchy nodes are already supported, so maybe that could be generalized.

Andras' description on Slicer mailing list:

'Segmentations can provide both labelmap or geometry output. So, the idea would be to allow selecting segmentation node for <image type='label'> (in addition to vtkMRMLLabelMapVolumeNode) and for <geometry type='model'> (in addition to vtkMRMLModelNode). This would allow using CLI modules with segmentations without any changes.

We would add a new type for overlapping labels (<image type='overlapping-label'>), which would pass a 4D NRRD file.

## #170 Improve leak finder
There are some ideas to improve LeakFinder. Further ideas are to be discussed under this ticket.

* In vtkDebugLeaksManager destructor, the counter never reaches 0 if StackWalker::ShowCallstack is called (otherwise it does), and so the Finalizing function is not called. There's a workaround in the current patch we made, but unfortunately that way many more objects are shown as leaking. It would be great if we found out what connection is there between calling ShowCallstack and that counter, and fix this issue. Ideas:
** Use ApplicationVerifier, maybe it unveils a memory corruption or something
** Use mutexes, maybe this issue is related to multitasking
* Filter out certain python calls from the stack trace: PyEval_EvalCodeEx, PyEval_EvalFrameEx, call_function, etc. Write 'NNN stack frames were skipped'

## #171 Create Slicer 4.2 branch for the SlicerRt extension
See Jc's email:

From: slicer-devel-bounces@bwh.harvard.edu [mailto:slicer-devel-bounces@bwh.harvard.edu] On Behalf Of Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin
Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2012 3:47 PM
To: Slicer devel
Subject: [slicer-devel] Important - Extensions and Slicer 4.2

Dear Extensions developer, 

Last week, when 4.2rc1 was made, I created a branch 4.2.0 (based on master) on the extensions index repository.

See https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/tree/4.2.0



Starting today and continuing tomorrow, the plan is to:

(1) Review list of extensions, check dashboard and documentation. I will then contact each extension developer.

(2) Reset 4.2.0 branch so that it corresponds to today's master. 

(3) Build the set of extensions that will be associated with 4.2 release using the 4.2.0 branch.

(4) Setup build scripts that will build 4.2.0 extensions on both a nightly and continuous basis.


What are the implication for extension developers ?
=======================================

These past few months, you'all have been submitting topics with your updated description file. Then, these ones have been integrated either  (a) with manual merge or (b) using pull request by extension index gate keepers.

Moving forward, the Slicer Core will evolve and backward compatibility will be broken, API will be refined and/or refactored, library version will be updated ... just to name few: ITKv4, Qt 4.8, ... 

If you plan on developing your extension against both Slicer 4.2 release and Slicer Nightly, I would recommend you to create a branch named '4.2' where you would backport bug fixes and improvement specific to 4.2 release.

Practically, I would also recommend to have two build trees on your developer workstation:

  1) Slicer-Superbuild-Release - build against a source tree following slicer trunk

  2) Slicer-Superbuild-420-Release - build against Slicer r21298 corresponding to Slicer 4.2 release.

Note that if you check out tag v4.2.0 using git, you will have to make sure to sync with svn so your build of Slicer is associated with svn r21298.

Having these two build tree would allow you to build and test your extension in the 4.2 and Nightly scenario. 

Consider also reading extensions manual build instructions.

Let me know if you have any questions, 
Thanks
Jc

## #179 Colors are sometimes not passed after loading a scene
If I convert a contour to closed surface representation after loading from DICOM module, it works fine, but if I do the same after saving a scene, it cannot find the color table entry.

The problem is that when saving a scene, the spaces in the color table entry names are replaced with underscores (eg. 'Femoral Head Lt' -> 'Femoral_Head_Lt'), so the original structure name cannot be found in the color table any more.

Possible solutions:
1. Save them in the color table with underscores in the first place (workaround)
2. When looking for the color, try to find it both with spaces both with underscores (workaround)
3. Change vtkMRMLColorTableNode WriteXML so that it can handle color  names that include spaces (takes longer as we have to bug the Slicer guys and have their approval)

## #180 DVH computation fails on non-dose volumes
Tested on Slicer 4.2.0-2012-11-05 (Win64).

How to reproduce:
* Load RANDO^PROSTATE dataset
* Go to DVH module
* Keep the default selection for the dose volume (PELVIS CURATIVE) and structure set
* Click DVH => crash

If I compute some DVH using the real dose volume and then select the CT as dose volume then there is no crash, but no DVH results appear.

## #183 ContourMorphology module issues and enhancements
I've done some testing today on the most recent version of the experimental ContourMorphology module (SVN rev 440) and found the followings:
* the generated output volume is not a labelmap
* if the volume is generated again then the output labelmap is not updated
* if the contour is ribbon, then the output is not generated and the viewers become unresponsive
* if the contour is closed surface, then the output is strange, it seems to replace the input contour
* the generated contour is not under the same hierarchy
* generate default output contour name automatically from the current contour and operation


#### 2012-11-14, 21:34:30 - wangk
I have tested the following issues and here is my comments:

* the generated output volume is not a labelmap
The module is to morph the contour. so the logical output should be a contour instead of a labelmap. you can then change the representation in contour module.

* if the volume is generated again then the output labelmap is not updated
I checked. it actually creates a new labelmap with a new name. I will think about this.

* if the contour is ribbon, then the output is not generated and the viewers become unresponsive
* if the contour is closed surface, then the output is strange, it seems to replace the input contour
I have change the code so it will check the representation of the contour and will not perform morphology if it is not labelmap.

* the generated contour is not under the same hierarchy
I checked and it seems currently contour are not under hierarchy. only model can have hierarchy. you can verify that.

* generate default output contour name automatically from the current contour and operation
I will think about this.

(In r:446|slicerrt:446) Re #183: Check if the contour representation is labelmap before operation.


#### 2012-11-14, 21:54:46 - Andras Lasso
'change the code so it will check the representation of the contour and will not perform morphology if it is not labelmap' => this should not be the final solution. Regardless of what is the current representation, the module should work on any contour. You can choose between the following options:
* implement the expand/shrink operation algorithm for each representation (have different algorithm for each representation; or convert the source contour internally to a labelmap, do the expansion, then convert back to the original representation)
* let the user know that this algorithm doesn't work on the current representation (and maybe offer to convert to the needed representation)

'contour are not under hierarchy' => There is a contour hierarchy (similar to models, annotations, and transforms). They are completely independent from the model hierarchies. Unfortunately, currently you can't see or edit the contour hierarchy in the Data module, but we plan to implement that, too. See 'vtkMRMLContourHierarchyNode' and/or ask Csaba about the details.

Default output contour name: it's planned to be implemented for other modules as well, so check with Csaba about how he does it.

#### 2012-11-14, 22:02:00 - wangk
I already do the option 2 by display a warning text once user select a contour that does not contain labelmap. just like in DVH module if user pick a none dose volume.

Yes. you are right. the contour hierarchy is not displayed correctly in the data module. that is what I mean. I will add the new contour into the hierarchy.

I will check with Csaba about the default output name.

## #184 Fix small outstanding issues before the 0.6.0 release
SlicerRT issues:
* Contours: disable backface culling (body contour may be open and looks strange when looking at from the inside) *-> Fixed*
* Contours: after doing a ribbon->closed surface->ribbon conversion it's not possible to switch to closed surface representation (only if I change the oversampling factor) *-> Fixed*
* Dose Comparison: 'Selected reference volume is not a dose' is not displayed until changing the dose volume selection (by default the 'PELVIS CURATIVE' volume was selected and there was no warning until I changed the selection) *-> Fixed*
* Dose accumulation: When an image is transformed the 'Dose accumulation: image information does not match!' message is logged only in the error console. The error should be displayed on the module GUI. *-> Fixed*
* Isodose: slice intersection lines don't appear on the slice viewers => test it on latest Slicer4 *-> Fixed* (appears in release mode for sure)
* Isodose: when increasing the number of iso levels with the spinbox then for every 2nd item the color is black and the opacity is 0 *-> Invalid?*
* Isodose: when editing the number of isolevels in the editbox from the default 6 to 10 then all the level values are replaced by '(none)' (except the first). The colors and opacity values are correctly preserved. *-> Ticket 187 created*
* Plastimatch B-spline registration: does not do anything if sample MRBrainTumor1/2 images are selected as input, warped and vector field outputs are selected, and Register is pressed *-> Cannot reproduce*
* LANDWARP registration crashes Slicer - try with latest slicer! (even if just two input volumes and an output volume is specified) *-> Fixed* *-> Fixed (CP)*
* XFORMWARP: could not test it without landwarp *-> Tested, works*
* Contours: when changing the 'Current contour(s)' selection don't change the 'Change active representation section' (it's quite difficult to change the active representation of 5 contours, because currently I always have to reselect the 'Convert To' item) *-> Fixed*

SlicerRT enhancements:
* DVH: for intensity volume histograms it would be nicer to have 'Max intensity' instead of 'Max dose (N/A)' (same for mean and min) *-> Fixed*
* DoseAccumulation: create default accumulated dose volume name (e.g., Accumulated_Dose1_Dose2_Dose3) *-> Fixed*
* Contours: after doing a ribbon->closed surface->ribbon conversion the oversampling factor is not editable, but the target reduction facor is; it should be consistent *-> Fixed*
* Contour Comparison: when 'Reference volume' is disabled (I assume that it's automatically determined) then display on the GUI what reference volume is actually used *-> Fixed*
* DICOM-RT import: If the same dose volume is loaded twice, its name is not changed (I would've expected a _1 postfix in the name) *-> Fixed*
* Dose Comparison: create a default gamma volume name from the reference and compare dose volume names (DoseComparison_RTDOSE1_RTDOSE2 or GammaVolume_RTDOSE1_RTDOSE2) *-> Fixed*

 
Slicer core issues:
* labelmap volumes appear in the foreground/background even if they are hidden in the scene
* labelmap volumes do not appear in the Volumes module even if they are visible in the scene

Hi Csaba,  Thank you for the detailed report.  I will fix plastimatch plugins.

I tested plastimatch B-spline here (linux), and it is working fine.  
This is windows?  Is it release version of slicer, or you built it?
Is it downloaded extension or you built it?


#### 2012-11-14, 13:39:34 - Csaba Pinter
Hi Greg,
Andras discovered these bugs, I should have mentioned it in the ticket description.
I'm pretty sure he tested on Windows 7, with Slicer and SlicerRT manually built in 64 bit.

#### 2012-11-14, 14:10:21 - Greg Sharp
OK, thanks.  I did test 32-bit build on windows 7, and B-spline is working well there too.

LANDWARP is a different issue.  Slicer changed the fiducials to annotations, and now I can't even create fiducial lists which are required for input.

Re: 'Isodose: when increasing the number of iso levels with the spinbox then for every 2nd item the color is black and the opacity is 0'

For me every color after the 6th one (7,8,9,...) is gray with opacity 0.8. What is the desired behavior?

Re: 'Isodose: when editing the number of isolevels in the editbox from the default 6 to 10 then all the level values are replaced by '(none)' (except the first). The colors and opacity values are correctly preserved.'

It is because when you start typing 10, the first character is 1 so it decreases the number so forgetting the labels when deleting the colors. I don't know if it is an issue to take care of. I think the only thing we can do is to keep track of the level names in the module, and restore them if the number is decreased then increased again.
Thoughts?

## #186 DVH computation fails when using the same structure with dose and then CT
If I compute a DVH for the Rando prostate Bladder structure on its dose volume and then its CT volume, the intensity histogram is not created (DVHLogic::461 no voxels in structure). The order doesn't matter, it fails when I first compute with the CT.
I think part of the structure is out of the second volume and the contour is not re-converted

There are two problems with this:
* The error should be catched in a different way. Maybe checking the cause of this error if my suspicion is confirmed.
* Display the error message on the GUI (just in the case of Dose Accumulation and Contour Comparison modules)

## #187 Undesired deletion of isodose levels when entering two-digit number
When editing the number of isolevels in the editbox from the default 6 to 10 then all the level values are replaced by '(none)' (except the first). The colors and opacity values are correctly preserved

It is because when you start typing 10, the first character is 1 so it decreases the number so forgetting the labels when deleting the colors. I don't know if it is an issue to take care of. I think the only thing we can do is to keep track of the level names in the module, and restore them if the number is decreased then increased again.

When the number of isolevels is increased using the arrows the initial 6 labels stay correct but the new isolevel labels are set as '(none)'. The initial problem of typing in 10 to the editbox and having the isolevel labels replaced by '(none)' (except the first one) still occurs.

The initial 6 labels are our predefined isodose levels. If you need more levels, then you need to define it or we can set the predefined levels to 10 or 20. this way it will cover a large range. 

The initial problem should be fixed already. @mwelch, can you check if you are building the latest slicerRT please?

## #188 Handle putting the active contour representation under a transform

There are two problems in Slicer core related to this feature:
1. The Contour nodes do not appear in the transformable tree view in the Transforms module, and also cannot be drag&dropped in the Data module (when in Transform mode), so it is impossible to put a Contour under a transform. Maybe it is not important, but definitely strange, as the Contour nodes are transformable.
2. When changing the parent node of a Contour node programatically, it does not appear under the transform node in the Data module.
Probably the source of these two problems are the same, investigating now.

Note: Fixed by changing vtkTypeMacro ( vtkTypeMacro(vtkMRMLContourNode,vtkMRMLNode); => vtkTypeMacro(vtkMRMLContourNode,vtkMRMLDisplayableNode); )

## #189 Determine DVH labelmap conversion oversampling factor based on structure size
Ratio of boundary voxels is higher in case of structures with small volume, so the DVH is much more sensitive for the selection of the inlcuded voxels. A small difference in the way of determining the included voxels may result in a big difference in the DVH values.
To reduce this effect, a solution can be simply to increase the resolution of the labelmaps created from these structures.

Proposed solution:
* The DVH algorithm automatically determines a good oversampling for the labelmap conversion
* If there already is a labelmap in the processed contour, then it would be re-converted only if the user checks a checkbox on the module UI

This approach is also suggested in the following paper:
R. E. Drzymala, R. Mohan, L. Brewster, J. Chu, M. Goitein, W. Harms, and M. Urie. 'Dose-volume histograms'. International Journal of Radiation Oncology* Biology* Physics, 21(1), 71-78 (1991).

## #190 Build fails on linux and mac due to Plastimatch changes
* Use fixed SVN revision for 4.2
* Be more careful syncing the SlicerRT modules to the Plastimatch updates

#### 2012-11-26, 20:59:24 - Greg Sharp
I couldn't reproduce here.  What is the problem?

#### 2012-11-26, 21:19:13 - Csaba Pinter
All the nightly (both trunk and 4.2) builds on linux and mac fail. The error message is about including plmbase.h (http://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=49206).
The problem is, that their nightlies use the latest version from the ExtensionIndex, which still uses plmbase.

I'll update the ExtensionIndex files, hopefully it will fix that.

#### 2012-11-26, 21:33:35 - Greg Sharp
Well, this is odd.  I updated the SlicerRt code at the same time I updated the plastimatch code on Nov 22 (see https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/changesets/477), but this build is from Nov 24. 

For the CDash tests, is the SlicerRt version frozen?  If so, plastimatch version should be frozen too.

#### 2012-11-26, 21:40:23 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, this is a dilemma.
* If we freeze Plastimatch for the trunk, then we have to update the revision number in SlicerRT every time something relevant changes.
* If we don't freeze, then the nightly SlicerRT version doesn't keep up with the Plastimatch changes (this is the case now)
For now, I'll freeze it for 4.2, but not freeze it for the trunk. Then we can decide to freeze the trunk too.

(The link I sent you is for the 24th indeed, but the same is the case with today's dashboard.)

#### 2012-11-26, 23:18:32 - Andras Lasso
'SlicerRt version frozen? If so, plastimatch version should be frozen too'

For the Slicer 4.2 branch the freeze of SlicerRT is intentional. For the Slicer trunk there is some lag of the SlicerRT version update due to a limitation in the extension submission process (we are forced to specify a revision number for the extension, cannot just specify the latest trunk).

For the Slicer 4.2 branch we should just specify all the revisions of SlicerRT and Plastimatch.

For Slicer trunk we should request a change in the extension update procedure: we should be allowed to specify a latest trunk version of a repository. Otherwise the process is just too complicated (need to commit a revision to Plastimatch, update the Plastimatch revision and related code in SlicerRT, commit that revision, then push an ExtensionIndex update, create a pull request, wait for the completion, wait for the dashboard results, fix the problems reported on the dashboards and start again).

#### 2012-12-03, 17:58:49 - Csaba Pinter
I am thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of freezing Plastimatch revision in the SlicerRT trunk.
+ No surprises in the nightly builds / No need to push through a fundamental change in the extension update procedure
+ Compliance with the Slicer habits (external dependencies are frozen there)
- We have to modify the Plastimatch revision if a change is made that is required for SlicerRT development, or if fixes a major bug
+ No waiting for the Plastimatch build before the SlicerRT build every time there is a commit

My personal opinion is that we should freeze Plastimatch version in the trunk too. Then if we find that it doesn't work after all, we can request this change in the Slicer extension update procedure.

#### 2012-12-07, 17:50:20 - Greg Sharp
I feel this is a good solution.

#### 2012-12-07, 17:57:26 - Csaba Pinter
Greg,
Do you have 'releases' or revisions that are tagged as stable?
Or should I just test SlicerRT and if it works well then consider the actual revision stable?

#### 2012-12-07, 18:26:59 - Greg Sharp
All revisions which pass regression tests are considered stable.  However, I do also sometimes make tarball releases.

I propose running both SlicerRT & plastimatch regression tests.  If both suites pass, then the revision is stable.

#### 2012-12-07, 19:18:02 - Csaba Pinter
I tried to run the Plastimatch tests, but all of them fail. I'm doing something wrong.
Here is an example how I try to run one test and what I get.

#### 2012-12-07, 20:27:00 - Greg Sharp
The tests only works with a full build.  SlicerRt uses a mini-build.  We do have a dashboard.

http://cdash.tshack.net/index.php?project=Plastimatch

But it's currently not straightforward to understand which builds are relevant, nor which version is being tested.

Maybe we can just use SlicerRt test set?

Re #192: Add a python module that calculates the difference in volume between the closed surface and the binary/fractional labelmap representations as a percent of the closed surface volume. This could method could potentially be used as a contour conversion error metric (provided that a closed surface representation has been constructed.

Re #192: Remove the binary/fractional labelmap calculation method from the python module and reimplement it in the C++ helper function. This also included some bug fixes, as the python version contained a mistake. Implemented inheritance for the VolumeCalculator class and widget from the scripted module parents, and removed redundant methods. Fixed the import statements for the util class to fit with the wrapped function name. Added comments and improved style.

Closing as fixed, because we cannot calculate and display error metrics in a practical way during regular use without significantly increased computation time, and the developed modules are adequate for manual calculation.

## #193 Create a tool that can convert tracked ultrasound sequences to CT volumes
Create a tool that can convert tracked ultrasound sequences to CT volumes, for prostate HDR brachytherapy planning.

Sample script is available here:
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/SlicerRt/sandbox/UsToCtConverterSample

The final solution should be something like this:
* A standalone executable, which uses Plus and DCMTK
* Plus is used to read the input ultrasound sequence metafile (mha) acquired using the Plus toolkit
* DCMTK is used to construct a sequence of CT slices that contain all the mandatory fields (the CT data set in the UsToCtConverterSample/originalCT directory contains some optional, private fields as well, so not all of them have to be included, only those required by the DICOM standard Part 3)
* Some fields are updated in the sample script (pixel data, image size, etc.), but some more fields would need to be updated in the final solution (at least new instance UID should be generated for each slice)

Optional:
* Would be nice to get the pixel spacing from the Plus configuration file (from the ImageToProbeTransform matrix)
* Would be useful to be able to burn in the centerline of reconstructed needle trajectories into the US image pixels to improve the catheter visibility
* Might be useful to support arbitrary image orientation (for freehand tracked US acquisition; by reconstructing an US volume)


#### 2012-12-05, 03:17:44 - Gabor Fichtinger
We also need to get the US pixel size ; TRUS stepping is hard coded at 5mm. 
 
Soon enough, we will have to calibrate the stepper and provide coordinate transformation from 3D TRUS space to Template Space. Not forgetting that the face of the template is not encoded – the bastards; we will have to put the calibrated grid onto the Ultrasonix display to guide the insertion.

Whose implementation do we use in the current crude version you mention?

#### 2015-01-28, 14:24:13 - wangk
It is my version. I think I will refactor the code and make DRR generation a separate class so the logic can basically switch between different implementations.

is there any news from Michi from Vienna AKH?

#### 2015-01-28, 16:17:48 - Csaba Pinter
No I haven't heard from them since then.

Separating the DRR computation to its own class is a really good idea, I fully support it!

Unfortunately, no, nothing concrete anyway.  My guess is that it depends on the Xcode version, since they did move things from /Developer into a subdirectory of Xcode.

Can you add a test before doing the resampling? The best would be to check if the transform is identity, but it can be enough if you do the resampling if there is a parent transform.

## #197 Import beam geometry
It could be interesting to learn how to develop custom interactive widgets, but we could consider doing the following (much easier approach) instead:
* have a fiducial at each control point (source, isocenter, etc.): the user can manipulate (move around) these points or we can lock the fiducials to prevent accidental editing
* develop a custom module that observes these fiducials (source, isocenter, etc.) and creates/updates a model based on these fiducial positions

Models are good, because all the infrastructure is there for show/hide, edit properties, show in 2D and 3D views, and we would need to develop all these for a custom widget.

## #198 Image information not set correctly when importing dicom-rt object
for example, when importing 'rando prostate' data from the our sample repository, it reports image origin (162,105,-122) and spacing (2.5,2.5,2.5) where the actually spacing is (-2.5,-2.5,2.5). there are two options, when importing dicom objects, we can either keep the actual spacing or modify the origin. but if we choose to modify origin, we will have to resample the image. so I prefer to keep the actual spacing. It seems that slicer does not allow negative spacing. so we might need to talk to Steve about this.  

#### 2012-12-12, 18:33:15 - Greg Sharp
I prefer to keep original spacing as well, but ITK engineers disagree.  They specifically do not support negative spacing.

http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1ImageBase.html#acefbb1f360d1a1fdf3598726d84f4652



#### 2012-12-12, 19:02:39 - wangk
Thanks Greg. if that is the case, then the only option is to re-sample the image so that everything is consistent. I am not sure how slicer developers think about this. if they do allow negative spacing, then we can do re-sampling only if the module involves any ITK operations.

#### 2012-12-12, 20:14:08 - Andras Lasso
There are many things that the DICOM standard permits, but ITK does not (such as missing slices, non-uniform spacing, sparse volume, non-parallel slices), so some reinterpretation/conversion of the DICOM data is unavoidable. Also, it seems that the pixel spacing must be positive according to the latest DICOM standard (there was an error in the specification previously, see ftp://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/cp/CPack-52_PDF/cp956_lb.pdf).

So, I think it's a good idea to convert from negative spacing to positive by reordering slices/flipping pixel data. No resampling should be needed, so no information is lost.

#### 2012-12-12, 20:41:42 - wangk
Yes. It is re-ordering not re-sampling.  

#### 2013-01-10, 18:58:13 - wangk
As discussed on the message board, the information we see in the volume module is actually correct but incompletely displayed. (direction cosine is not displayed so that is why it is a bit confusing just looking at origin and spacing). and the solution to this after discussion with andras and Greg seems to be adding an option to display direction cosine in the volume module. I will ask Steve to see what he thinks, if he agrees, I will create a slicer ticket for this.

#### 2013-01-12, 20:15:31 - pieper
Yes, I agree that adding the direction vectors to the volume information widget would be great.  The info is easily available from the MRML Node for each direction i, j, k with for, example:

void vtkMRMLVolumeNode::GetIToRASDirection  (  double   dirs[3]  )  

And it could be added to this code:

http://slicer.org/doc/html/classqMRMLVolumeInfoWidget.html

When closing a ticket, please make sure the milestone is the current, so that if someone queries the completed tasks, they can see that this particular issue was fixed then.


## #199 DICOM browser column headings are not accurate
In the DICOM browser tree the 'age' field is filled with imaging modality information.

The issue is that the column headings are the same for patient, study, series level, while the information is clearly different. The proper implementation would be to have separate column heading for each level (or have multiple lists instead of a tree).

Should be solved by the new list-view based CTK DICOM browser

#### 2014-01-21, 20:18:06 - Csaba Pinter
The specific problem of the inaccurate hedings is solved by the new list-view DICOM browser, so this ticket can be closed.

However, the browser can still show only values of raw DICOM tags, which is not satisfactory (e.g. the series description text can be found in different tags for different modalities). This work is tracked in #535

## #200 Create volume data reader and writer functions for Matlab
Create volume data reader and writer functions for Matlab for metaIO (mhd, mha) files. As Slicer can read/write metaIO files these functions can be used for data exchange between Slicer and Matlab.

#### 2012-12-17, 03:36:53 - Andras Lasso
Work-in-progress implementation by Simrin is available at:
https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/nodes/trunk/SlicerRt/sandbox/SlicerMatlabBridge/MetaImageIO?rev=512

A few comments:
* In mha_read_header.m describe that AnatomicalOrientation value is ignored and assumed to be LPS. Describe it in the function documentation and note it where you actually override the AnatomicalOrientation value to LPS.
* Specify somewhere how to interpret the TransformMatrix matrix. Also, I would give a more descriptive name to this field. The info structure should be independent from the metaIO format as much as possible (in the future we may write other readers and writers that use the same info structure for other volume file formats).
* Describe the contents of the info structure somewhere. Give a more descriptive name than “info”, maybe “VolumeInfo”, “ImageVolume”, …
* readme.txt is somewhat redundant with the function documentation. Only have readme.txt if you have some high-level, common documentation (such as the description of the “info” structure).
* Add an automatic test script and test data (read, write, read, compare the pixel data and field values, etc. for mha, mhd, compressed, uncompressed)
* Maybe make the mha_read_header.m function a private function within mha_read_volume.m? It would be just more consistent with having a single mha_write_volume.m function. There could be an optional flag for the reading if we want to load the volume data or just the header info.

## #201 SlicerRT extension screenshots
Currently for me no SlicerRT screenshots appear in the extension manager for the latest stable Slicer. It seems that the URL is not OK (probably it should have been http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/images/7/75/SlicerRT0.6_Montage.png).

## #202 Make it more difficult to select a non-dose volume in the Dose Volume Histogram volume
I still often accidentally click on computing DVH on the CT.
What could help to avoid this issue:
* Hide non-dose volumes by default (have a checkbox to show all volumes)
* By default select the first dose volume
* Are you sure popup (I don't really like this)


#### 2012-12-19, 22:03:19 - pieper
You could assign an attribute to dose volumes and have the mrml node combo box only show nodes with that attribute (this feature is already supported for label maps)

#### 2012-12-19, 23:18:15 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks, Steve, good to know!
We already have attributes in the dose volumes, so it should be easy to do the filtering with this feature.

@lassoan: The label next to the combobox is 'Dose volume: '. Do you think I sould rename it to 'Input volume: '?
Or the intensity volume histogram is only a bonus feature and we don't want to confuse the user with such a label?

#### 2013-01-16, 20:58:09 - Andras Lasso
As the module's name is Dose Volume Histogram, I think it's better to keep the Dose volume. I would consider the intensity volume histogram computation to be a fallback mechanism, to be able to handle dose volumes that were not converted to real dose volumes. Once processed dose volumes will be dose volumes and the user can easily convert a regular volume to a dose volume then probably this intensity volume histogram feature can be removed.

Contour conversion is in Slicer core now, and it is done automatically, without user interaction (as opposed to when this ticket was created). Showing a progress bar would be thus confusing.
It is more desirable to try to speed up the conversion, which has happened (planar to surface) and is happening.now (fractional labelmap).
Closing this ticket as fixed.

I debugged into the DICOM volume loading of Plastimatch (because it can load these dose volumes), but I didn't find anything special.
Plastimatch ultimately uses itk::ImageSeriesReader for loading these volumes, and it works.
Slicer uses vtkITKArchetypeImageSeriesScalarReader, but it doesn't read these volumes.

I created http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2879 in Slicer Mantis for this issue.

#### 2013-01-24, 16:55:31 - Csaba Pinter

## #207 Load CERR PlanC files
This format ( http://www.cerr.info ) comes up a lot in RT dose research. It is a bunch of nested MATLAB structures in a cell array in a .MAT container. It's an adaptive format with a built-in index, and can contain almost anything- comments, 3D volumes, structure lists, DVH, etc.

CERR in particular is pretty common in RT research and the ability to read its files would make Slicer a lot more accessible to this community.

Thinking of this along with the fact that vtkSlicerDicomRtReader fails to wrap too, there may be something about the DicomRtImport/Logic project

#### 2013-02-14, 00:31:29 - Csaba Pinter
It turns out that if I change the name of the vtkTopologicalHierarchy class, the python wrapping error doesn't show up.

#### 2013-02-19, 20:56:22 - Csaba Pinter
I found that if dir(module) in importModuleObjects (Slicer-build/bin/Python/slicer/util.py) is the following list
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', 'vtkDICOMImportInfo', 'vtkTopologicalHierarchy', 'vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic']
instead of this (vtkTopologicalHierarchy comes before and not after vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic)
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', 'vtkDICOMImportInfo', 'vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic', 'vtkTopologicalHierarchy']
then there is no wrapping error.

I think the cause is that vtkDICOMImportInfo and vtkTopologicalHierarchy are not in the namespace vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic, and when vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic is wrapped, then vtkTopologicalHierarchy is not found in it.
What the solution should be?
1. Should I try to include these classes in the namespace?
2. Should I somehow change the order they appear? Is there a way? It looks alphabetical.
3. Should util.py check the availability of the symbol (= from_module_name.item_name) and try to add the class to the destination module without the from_module_name if it doesn't exist?

#### 2013-02-19, 20:59:13 - Csaba Pinter
Changing the class prevented the error, because that way vtkTopologicalHierarchy wasn't in the item list, because the class name didn't match the file name.

#### 2013-02-22, 21:08:36 - Csaba Pinter
The error 'SystemError: ..\\Objects\\classobject.c:508: bad argument to internal function' was fixed by the DicomRtImportSelfTestPaths fix (#214)

#### 2013-02-22, 22:11:00 - Csaba Pinter
The VTK classes that are next to a logic class should be wrapper properly. A Mantis issue has been created:

The vtkTopologicalHierarchy issue is different from the vtkSlicerDicomRtReader. The alphabetical order related error (see Mantis issue above) is fixed by the new wrapper, however the following classes still fail to wrap:
vtkSlicerDicomRtReader
vtkSlicerDicomRtWriter
vtkSlicerDicomSroReader

Hi - 

Smallish point - can you use UID rather than Uid for slicer code?  It's more consistent with common usage.  Thanks!

http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.2/Developers/Style_Guide#Naming

#### 2013-03-01, 16:08:02 - Csaba Pinter
Our convention (in Plus and in SlicerRt too) is to keep the camel case so that we can easily tell where the words end and begin, but in case of the classes that will potentially go in the Slicer core I'll try to stick to the Slicer convention.
I'll have to go through the files before integrating anyway, as sticking to the the Slicer brackets (in line with the block instead of the keyword before the block) are a pain in the neck using Visual Studio, so we don't do that either (and of course the line length restrictions etc :) ).

Idea 1:
Tags are only strings (not name,level pairs), and the Logic stores the hierarchies (name, ordered list of tags). The advantage is that this way the same PH node can indicate multiple 'hierarchies', i.e. tags that can be ordered, and by which they can be grouped, such as time, registration type, etc. Actions needed:
* Remove HierarchyTag class and store only a vtkStringArray in the PatientHierarchy nodes
* Create Logic class and move all the utility functions into it
* The DicomRtImportLogic should add the DICOM hierarchy in the logic, so that it knows the name of the hierarchy and the ordered list of tags (Patient, Study, Series...). It does it preferably when the scene is created or some event that happens after instantiating all module logics
* Where the level value is used and compared, the hierarchy from the logic should be used (the hierarchy name is an input to the utility function)

#### 2013-02-25, 23:33:08 - Csaba Pinter
Idea 2:
Store every PH-specific information in attributes of ordinary vtkMRMLHierarchyNodes with the attributes as 'tags'. One attribute could be (DicomLevel:[Patient/Study/...]), another could be (DicomDatabaseFileName:XY), and (Uid:Z). All the PH-specific utility functions would be in the PatientHierarchyLogic, and the vtkMRMLPatientHierarchyNode would not be necessary any more. The tree view and the proxy model would still be needed to decide whether the hierarchy node is a PH node (has all mandatory attributes).

## #215 Multiple RT objects with same type not distinguishable in DICOM module
When using DICOM module to import dose, plan and structure set, if there are multiple objects with same type. e.g. two rt dose files, there are no description to distinguish one from another. try pinnacle3-0.0-phantom data in SlicerRT data directory. Need to fix this as this is often encountered in adaptive RT. 

I have also created a slicer mantis issue http://na-mic.org/Mantis/view.php?id=2936




#### 2013-02-25, 22:40:07 - Andras Lasso
The information in the tree is generated by CTK, only from fields that are read from the database. These fields probably don't contain enough information to distinguish the dose files.

However, the names listed below the tree (when making a selection in the tree) are constructed by the DICOM importers. So, we should be able to generate more meaningful names in the list by tuning the DicomRtImport module logic.

## #219 Improve Contour Morphology module input handling
* If the input contours don't contain labelmap representation, then the module does not allow to use them. Thus the user has to go to the Contours module and convert them manually. This does not comply with the 'easy and automatic contour handling' that the Contours module was supposed to introduce. It would be better to add a Reference volume field that is used as reference in case an input contour does not contain labelmap representation. See Contour Comparison module as example.
* Review input contour names 'Reference' and 'Input'. Those seem not to mean anything. The reference contour is apparently not a reference to anything, and the input contour is obviously an input.
* When a one-operand operation is selected, disable the second input (whatever name will it have)
* Change line edits to spin boxes. It is tedious to actually enter any number in them
* Maybe add a checkbox 'Uniform' and if checked, disable the input fields for the different directions except for one

## #220 Dice similarity class causes conflict
Instantiating and using the Dice_statistics class prevents the containing module to be successfully loaded by Slicer.

The Contour Comparison module thus cannot compute Dice similarity metrics, because the related code had to be commented in the logic so that the module appears in Slicer. When the code that instantiates and uses the Dice_statistics class is uncommented (see revision 620), then the module disappears from Slicer.

If omp.h is not included, but the Dice class is in use (i.e. instantiated), then the DLL loading fails under windows, and the module does not appear in the module list, accompanied by an error message in the Error log, that qSlicerContourComparisonModuleWidget class could not be loaded by Slicer.

## #226 Plastimatch CUDA acceleration is disabled
There are two issues building plastimatch when CUDA is installed.

(1) On linux & mac, if gcc 4.3 is not installed, the build fails
(2) On windows, the nvcc call fails because command line is too long

CUDA build will be disabled until these are fixed

I did some testing on this, using MSVC 2010 compiler.

(1) SlicerRT builds plastimatch as shared lib

(2) plmutil.lib correctly includes dependency on VCOMP.LIB, as evidenced by:


~~~~

dumpbin /all plmutil.lib

~~~~

Which shows


~~~~

/DEFAULTLIB:'VCOMP'

~~~~


(3) A test executable which does not include <omp.h> and does not use '/openmp' option was created and linked against plmutil.h.  


~~~~

cl /MD main.cxx plmutil.lib plmbase.lib plmsys.lib


~~~~

This executable was found to correctly depend on VCOMP100.DLL

@gregsharp I moved this ticket to EBP so that most Plastimatch-related tickets are in the same place. Also this looks like an outlier in the 1,0 release milestone, as it doesn't belong to the 'product release' tasks. Apparently you didn't like this in the EBP milestone, but I don't like it in the 1.0 one, so I'm moving this to Future.

## #228 Check dimensions when oversampling labelmap
In case of oversampling factor 2.0, the dimensions of the result is not exactly doubled (512->1023). Origin also changes slightly.
Investigate why and fix.

#### 2013-02-21, 23:27:56 - Csaba Pinter
vtkImageResample filter works as follows: If the original image has the size 512x512x512, then the extents are ([0,511],[0,511],[0,511]). The filter doubles the max extent value, so it becomes ([0,1022],[0,1022],[0,1022]). So the output has the image size 1023*1023*1023

This issue is tracked in #229

## #229 Labelmap resampling does not exactly work according to the magnification factor
vtkImageResample filter works as follows: If the original image has the size 512x512x512, then the extents are ([0,511],[0,511],[0,511]). The filter doubles the max extent value, so it becomes ([0,1022],[0,1022],[0,1022]). So the output has the image size 1023*1023*1023

This is not acceptable so it is needed to replace vtkImageResample with vtkImageReslice filter. Maybe also adding a convenience function for it (due to the increased number of parameters to set) to SlicerRtCommon

#### 2013-02-21, 23:09:42 - Andras Lasso
Most likely the problem is not due to concavity but due to converting the contours from ribbon to labelmap on a modified volume. Doing it in two steps should work correctly: convert from ribbon to closed surface using the original CT as reference, then convert the closed surface to labelmap on the transformed CT.

We plan to implement a more advanced planar contour to closed surface converter (see #103), that will resolve this.

#### 2013-02-21, 23:34:21 - Csaba Pinter
Answer to the reporter:
'The problem is that the transformed ribbon models are not aligned with the volume you're using as a reference. If you convert the ribbon models from the original study using the planning CT, and then transform those closed surface models using your transform, then you can convert to labelmap properly for comparison.'

It seems that the workaround doesn't always help. Check if it's possible to modify the workflow to avoid ribbon->labelmap and closed surface->labelmap conversion on a modified reference volume (e.g., apply the deformation on the labelmap).

I think Csaba's workaround should work most of the time. One thing that would make this more robust and convenient is to have the patient hierarchy ready so the ribbon model know where to look for the referenced CT volume and the ribbon model is converted to labelmap when it is imported into slicer (we can keep both ribbon model and labelmap). then you can use labelmap for the actual transformation and then get updated the ribbon model from the transformed labelmap.

Great idea, Kevin! One more reason to finally finish the patient hierarchy.

#### 2013-02-27, 12:55:01 - Andras Lasso
Actually, we could just save the referenced volume's origin, spacing, and direction as a MRML node custom attribute. Then, when a conversion to labelmap is needed, it could be done it two steps:
# Convert to labelmap in referenced volume space (probably oversampled 2x or 4x)
# Resample the generated labelmap in the requested space

This two-step conversion takes more time and there could be some minor differences in the end result, but it's quite simple to do and seems to be robust (see http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/887). I think we should implement this to have a robust solution until the direct contour->closed surface implementation and a reliable closed surface->image algorithms are ready.

## #232 Investigate DVH differences due to change in resampling
Resampling has been recently (rev640) changed, which affected the DVH computation. Although in case of most structures the change is insignificant, there are some that needs to be investigated.
These structures are
* Rectum form the Prostate phantom against Eclipse, change: 95.8%->66.4%
* BRSTEM from the Ent phantom against both, change 100%->65%/43%
It is very strange though that other small structures such as optic nerves and lenses perform the same, but these two somehow perform very bad. 
Full report attached.

## #238 Automatic test for Dose Comparison
* Perform recommended tutorial http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Extensions/SlicerRT#Tutorials to create two similar but different dose volumes to test gamma computation
** Use this gamma volume as baseline for the test
* Use Dose Accumulation logic test as sample

## #240 Import volumes in VFF format to Slicer
VFF format is heavily used in dosimetry evaluation in KGH and other sites, and it would be very useful to load them in Slicer.

The ideal solution would be a plugin that registers itself as a standard reader to Slicer. Need to investigate the mechanism.
Sample VFF files will be obtained from the KGH folks.

As we discussed, here are the very first steps to have the module skeleton:
* Checkout SlicerRt trunk
* Create VFF plugin folder in the sandbox (VffFileReader)
* Copy sample files (Resources/UI/...ui, q...IO.cxx,h) from Volumes module
* Modify UI to be empty using designer (...\\Slicer_Trunk_R64-bin\\Slicer-build\\Slicer.exe --designer)
* Change ...Widget.cxx accordingly
* Modify plugin cxx to accept VFF files and to create and use the Logic class instance
* Create Logic class in Logic directory. Make it a proper VTK class (no pipeline support for now, see SlicerRtCommon\\vtkLabelmapToModelFilter.cxx)
* Modify CMakeLists.txt files (to add Logic directory but not the others, etc.)
* Make module hidden (see DicomRtImportModule.h)
* Register plugin in Slicer (see qSlicerVolumesModule::setup() method, where the plugin is added to the IO manager. The same thing needs to be done in the ...Module.cxx file)
* Create binary directory, then configure with CMake (like the module in the programming tutorial) and build
* Add new module to Slicer (Edit / App Settings / Modules / Additional module paths)
* Commit
After this is done, we only need to work with the Logic class from then on

A note for future reference:
The file IO plugins are sub-classes of the qSlicerFileReader class. After overriding the necessary functions and registering the reader to qSlicerCoreIOManager, the plugin will take care of loading the files with the specified file extensions.
The plugin in the Volumes module (qSlicerVolumesIO.cxx/h, qSlicerVolumesIOOptionsWidget.cxx/h, qSlicerVolumesIOOptionsWidget.ui and registering in qSlicerVolumesModule::setup) is a good example for the new plugin.

You will need to rename these files later. Please make sure that you use SVN rename instead of a simple rename in windows. I usually do that using TortoiseSVN. Just right-click on the file, find TortoiseSVN / Rename and enter the new name. If it's a cxx or an h file, it will offer you to rename the other one too.

## #241 Clean up Contour Morphology automatic test
* Every sub-test (morphological operator) should have its own baseline. It is not adequate to check if the output of each test step has more voxels than an arbitraty number (1000 in this case). Ideally the results would be cheched against baseline labelmap volumes, but I think it is adequate to check if the number of non-background voxels in the computed results match the defined baseline (separate number for each step)
* All inputs need to come from the CMakeLists.txt file
** The file defined with full path should be defined with the file name only, as this is why the Data directory is defined
** There should not be burnt-in strings in the source code, such as '/PTV_Contour_Labelmap.nrrd'. All these inputs should come from the test definition
* Add another test that contains a volume that is transformed (has a transform node associated), to check the capability to deal with transforms. For simplicity, one additional parameter (e.g. ApplySimpleTransformToInput2) containing whether or not the second inpuit is transformed is enough. Create a very simple transform in the code and apply it, then compare it to the baseline that is got from Slicer by using the very same transform.
* Fix misleading comments in the code
* Remove unused #include directives
* Stick to coding conventions, especially
** Local variables should start with small letters and capitals for the beginning of each word (e.g. contourComparisonLogic)
** Use full words, don't shorten, e.g. PTV_Labelmap_Exp -> PTV_Labelmap_Expanded

The result of morphology operation is checked against the corresponding baseline data as volume difference in number of voxels. this might not be the optimum way. any suggestion?

#### 2013-04-03, 17:00:42 - wangk
Thanks Csaba for changing the names. I found it today and was going to update them but you already got it. 

Quick question regarding applying the transform. seems they have changed the code in vtkMRMLtransformableNode.cxx. now GetParentTransformNode returns something different. are you familiar with this? what is the difference between parenetTransformNode and the TransformNode in the class. it seems that if you create a transformNode in transform module and put a contourNode under this transformNode, it will use setAndObserveTransformNodeID method which will set the transformNode not the parentTransformNode.

#### 2013-04-03, 17:20:12 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, you get it right. Now the ParentTransformNode function is deprecated (I guess), and I think they only kept the GetParentTransformNode function for backwards compatibility. The right usage is to set the TransformNodeID.

The RTPlan module is in a separate AdaptiveRT module category by itself. Is it intentional?

Also I would rename the module to be more human readable and to more reflect the actual usage of the module.

## #244 DCMTK_DIR vs. DCMTKConfig.cmake
A fresh build against Slicer HEAD (2013-03-30) fails to configure with the following error:

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
DCMTK_dcmrt_LIBRARY
    linked by target 'vtkSlicerDicomRtImportModuleLogic' in directory /home/gsharp/build/slicer-4/SlicerRT/DicomRtImport/Logic

It seems Slicer is not setting CTK_DCMTK_DIR and/or DCMTK_DIR correctly.  On my machine, here is how they are set:

/home/gsharp/build/slicer-4/Slicer-build/DCMTK-install/lib/cmake/dcmtk

This is the new location for DCMTKConfig.cmake, and no longer the location of DCMTK install directory.

Hi Greg, 

The path to DCMTK_DIR should now be: /home/gsharp/build/slicer-4/Slicer-build/DCMTK-build/lib/cmake/dcmtk The different is explained by 


(1) the fact, a previous build of DCMTK exported its tree to the user package registry (~/.cmake/package/DCMTK/..)


(2) a problem with the Generation of SlicerConfig.cmake, in a clean build tree, DCMTK_DIR is set to an empty string.


I am looking in that problem and will submit a patch.


Thanks for you detailed report, 
Jc

#### 2013-04-01, 12:58:48 - Greg Sharp
Thanks Jc.  SlicerRT doesn't currently source DCMTKConfig.cmake i.e. no find_package() call.   Instead, it assumes a relative path based on ${CTK_DCMTK_DIR}.  This is to find dcmrt library not normally included in ${DCMTK_LIBRARIES}.  I wonder is this approach obsolete?  Should we instead call find_package()?

#### 2013-04-01, 21:10:28 - Csaba Pinter
It still does not compile on Windows. I'll try to apply a quick workaround for myself, but it would be important that it works the proper way on the long run.

Hi Folks,

## #247 Add transform whole study feature to Subject Hierarchy
When applying a transform to a SH node, all children nodes should be put under the same transform too.

Based on a discussion with Andras, the best course of action seeme like this:
* The transform nodes do not appear in the subject hierarchy tree as individual rows
* Instead, a new column should be added for the transformations applied to each node
** The column contains a listbox containing the names of the available transforms, with the applied one selected if any, otherwise empty selection
** When a branch is transformed (using a context menu action), then the selected transform is applied to all the children nodes of the current node. If a child node is already transformed, then show a popup dialog offering
*** Harden current transform and apply the just selected one
*** Apply selected transform on applied transform
*** Abort
*** ('Replace the current transform to the just selected one' was one candidate but it seems to make little sense)
** The column width is limited, but the opened listbox has the width of the longset transform name (similar to configuration file selector in fCal)
* A transform is exported as a registration object if the study to be exported contains nodes under that transform

## #251 Compensate for voxel volume change after resampling using deformation field
When we resample a dose distribution image using a deformation field, the physical volume represented by each voxel changes.
As the dose volume voxel values are based on the voxel volumes, we should compensate for this change.

#### 2013-04-04, 15:39:15 - Greg Sharp
No change in dose is necessary.  Dose is J/kg.  Even if voxels become less dense, dose is the same.

#### 2013-04-04, 15:56:40 - Csaba Pinter
Good to know, thanks! I talked with a MeVis person in Vienna and he told me that the distortion introduced by a derofmable resampling changes the dose values.

#### 2013-04-04, 16:00:43 - Greg Sharp
Probably worth getting more details.  Maybe he means something other than density change by expansion/contraction.

#### 2013-04-04, 16:50:14 - wangk
The dose value and the volume size can be changed due to image resampling. This is just the nature of image resampling.

I added the screenshot above so that you can see how the Patient Hierarchy looks like right after the prostate phantom dataset is loaded.

Please share your ideas how to make it more logical and more conform to the DICOM standard.
What I already suspect is that separating the isocenters and the beam models are not very smart, but this is how it was convenient to implement until there is a better suggestion.

Also need to handle the case when an RT Structure Set contains both points and contours (in case of the beam examples, this is the case, an Isocenter is listed in the Structure set), because then two PH nodes are created for the same series.

#### 2013-05-31, 22:24:20 - Csaba Pinter
It is needed to consolidate loaded data after all series (loadables) have been loaded.
For example if the structure set is loaded before the CT, then the patient hierarchy connection between the two cannot be set, as there is no PH node for the CT yet. This has to be done after loading of all data is done.

As a first approach, I added a new function to the DICOMPlugin class (loadFinished), overriding which these steps can be performed. This function is called in DICOMWidgets::loadCheckedLoadables after the loadables have been handled by each plugin. If the method is not overridden, then it does nothing.

The above picture shows how it looks like now.
The difference between this and the Eclipse screenshot are:
* Naming: Isocenters VS Fields
* Node names are preficed with the type of the node, e.g. 'PELVIS CURATIVE' -> 'Image: PELVIS CURATIVE', or 'Bladder_Contour' -> 'Structure: Bladder_Contour'
* The objects related to the beams are put under the beam objects. We don't have DRRs loaded well yet, but conforming to the example, the isocenter would have two children, a DRR and a beam model. The only problem with this approach is that the possibility of changing the visibility of all the objects at once would no longer exist (i.e. 'set visibility for object type' -> 'set visibility of all objects related to a beam')

What should I implement from the above differences? If we all agree then I'll do it and then we can close this.

Smoothing would be useful for demonstration purposes.

Also it is questionable whether the target reduction factor is useful at all.

## #255 Stable Mac release cannot load modules because of libITKIOReview.3.20
The Mac release 0.9 for stable Slicer 4.2.2-1 cannot load plastimatch modules and the plastimatch-based SlicerRT modules.

The log says libITKIOReview.3.20 cannot be found.

We should either fix this, or wait for 4.3 that contains ITK4.

#### 2013-04-13, 14:04:57 - Csaba Pinter
@gregsharp: What do you think? We had some issues with this lib, but it seems to be coming back.

#### 2013-04-15, 12:46:14 - Greg Sharp
Hm, not sure.  How did we fix last time?

#### 2013-04-15, 12:48:26 - Csaba Pinter
I think it was this Slicer fix:
http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/Slicer4/trunk/Applications/SlicerApp/CMakeLists.txt?r1=21671&r2=21670&pathrev=21671

#### 2013-04-15, 12:51:32 - Csaba Pinter
Oh, I see. This fix has been committed after releasing 4.2, so most probably we never had plastimatch-related modules in the stable Mac release. Oops...
I think there is only one thing we can do: wait for 4.3 and apologize to the Mac users in the meantime.

#### 2013-04-15, 12:54:01 - Greg Sharp
Sounds good.

#### 2013-04-15, 13:16:56 - Andras Lasso
If it is not possible (or not worth the trouble) to disable the non-compiling Plastimatch parts for Slicer 4.2 then please update the Slicer 4.2 documentation on the Slicer wiki to clarify this.

#### 2013-04-15, 13:31:20 - Csaba Pinter
I added notes on the SlicerRT page for Slicer 4.2 (http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.2/Extensions/SlicerRT), the Plastimatch page (for 4.2) and the affected modules' pages.

#### 2013-04-15, 17:04:11 - Csaba Pinter
Plastimatch-related modules will not appear in SlicerRT for Slicer 4.2 or older on Mac. This issue will be fixed with Slicer 4.3

## #257 Deformation field visualizer Contour visualization mode is slow
Deformation field visualizer in Contour visualization mode generates too detailed model and it makes the rendering very slow.

Tested on a linear transformation (with translation and rotation components) using the MRHead sample as reference image.

status: changed from "New" to "Accepted"

#### 2013-04-19, 16:06:26 - Andras Lasso
Grid visualization is also similarly slow. The problem is that even for a simple 5x5x5 grid, over 8.5 million points are generated!!!
(using the linear transform and MRHead volume). It should be enough to have a point in each grid point (if visualization of sparse grids is not nice then maybe you can subdivide each line to 5-10 segments at most).

#### 2013-04-19, 17:21:00 - Franklin King
Would it make any sense to have two subsample settings? One for the number of points generated (and 'smoothness' of the grid) with 5-10 as the default or max and one for the number of actual grid lines shown? One of the earlier versions had only 1 point for each grid point and it ended up looking a little jagged and lost quite a bit of the information.

#### 2013-04-19, 17:25:13 - Andras Lasso
A few points for each grid section should be enough. Make the subsampling a configurable parameter in the code (a named constant), so that we can easily change it, but I don't think it has to be editable on the GUI.

## #258 Deformation field visualizer does not show slice intersections in the slice viewers
Slice intersections should be visible for the Glyph/Grid Slice visualization modes. The option is enabled in the Models module, but the intersections are still not visible.
This is a Slicer core issue, which happened in the past (e.g., http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=1536 and maybe there are also open tickets for this), so ask about this on the mailing list before entering a ticket in the Slicer bugtracker.


#### 2013-04-16, 15:08:57 - Andras Lasso
There is a workaround for this problem: check mrmlScene->StartState(vtkMRMLScene::BatchProcessState); in vtkConvertContourRepresentations.cxx.
You can implement this workaround to get this working now, but also make sure that there is an open Slicer bugtracker item to track the resolution (if you don't find any open Slicer bug report about this then ask about it on the slicer-devel mailing list).

#### 2013-04-16, 16:02:37 - Franklin King
The workaround caused a few instability issues resulting in periodical crashes when I last implemented it a while ago. I'll have another go at it now and see if I can pin down the problem.

#### 2013-04-16, 16:43:43 - Andras Lasso
OK. If you find any scenario that causes Slicer to crash (preferably in a reproducible way) then please report it on the Slicer bugtracker.

## #259 Deformation field visualizer module should not show 'None' option in the the slice selector
Currently if 'None'  slice is selected and you click on the visualize button then nothing happens. The model is not updated, no message is displayed on the module GUI, no error or warning is logged, no popup is displayed.

The simplest would be to not show 'None' option in the the slice selector at all.

## #260 Deformation field visualizer slice glyphs are not organized into slices
When visualizing a deformation field that contains rotation component, the generated planes no longer parallel with the planes of the reference image. If there is out-of-plane translation then the translation should be projected to the image plane (the out-of-plane translation component that is orthogonal to the image plane shall be set to zero).

Tested on a linear transformation (with translation and rotation components) using the MRHead sample as reference image.

I may not be understanding the issue correctly, but I'm having trouble reproducing the problem.

Images 2 to 4 are the result of a visualization of the same rotation. Both glyph slice and grid slice seem to project the vectors it to the selected plane. Image 1 is the result of three rotations.

If you apply rotation in an arbitrary angle and choose a slice visualization option then the arrows or grid should be shown in the selected slice plane. However, this is not the case: arrows are not parallel with the selected slice plane, as you can see on this video: http://screencast.com/t/9hlKbsGdA.

#### 2013-04-19, 17:40:00 - Franklin King
There is still a seemingly unrelated bug where glyphs projected to a slice with a normal of [1,0,0] are not oriented consistently in terms of their rotation. The end result is that the lines in the slice view are correct, but the arrow tips are warped. It's mainly only noticeable with a very high magnitude of deformation (such as rotation transformation).

@wangk: I have removed a lot of unnecessary include and link dependencies. It is important not to include or link to files and libraries that the library in question does not need. Please review commit 760. Also it is a good idea to stick to the coding conventions in order to have high-quality, readable code. Thanks!

#### 2013-04-15, 20:59:40 - wangk
Thanks. Like I said before, this is the work in progress which needs many improvements. that is why I kept it in the ART repository and did not want to put it in SlicerRT. I moved it over without much work simply because I hope Greg and Maxim could start to work on it as soon as possible. I could fix all these but again this will delay their work if they want to start soon.

#### 2013-04-15, 21:03:59 - Csaba Pinter
I understand, but quality code is not created from spaghetti code just before release. It is a continuous process to keep it good. If you don't do that, it won't be possible to make it good without unacceptably large workload.


## #266 Rename RTPlan module to External Beam Planning
1. The module name does not tell much. RTPlan is a DICOM modality.
2. There are no Slicer modules with names like this (one word, capital letters, etc.). They all have human readable nice names
3. It just doesn't look good in the list

## #267 Deformation field visualizer should give some feedback during computation
After pressing the 'Visualize' button the user often has to wait for several seconds and it's not clear if anything is happening or when the result is ready.

It would be useful to give some feedback to the user that a computation is in progress, e.g., change the 'Visualize' button text to 'Processing...' and make it grayed until the model generation is complete.

## #268 Empty model hierarchy nodes are added when contours are converted
When I switch between contour representations (maybe regenerating the contours with different reduction factors) then I switch to the Models module there are many ModelHierarchy_NN nodes without any child nodes. If I do some additional switches then even more such empty child nodes are generated.

The number of empty hierarchy nodes are constantly growing: if I re-generate closed surfaces 10 times with different reduction factors then I end up having more than a hundred empty hierarchy nodes.

I am very glad this is getting cleaned up for the release. Thanks--Gabor

The problem is that in case of the DeformationFieldVisualizer generic tests, the additional directories are not set. The command line is this:

C:\\devel\\Slicer_Trunk_D64-bin\\Slicer-build\\Slicer.exe '--launcher-no-splash' '--launch' 'C:/devel/SlicerRT_D64-bin/inner-build/bin/Debug/qSlicerDeformationFieldVisualizerModuleCxxTests.exe' 'qSlicerDeformationFieldVisualizerTest'

but should be like this:

C:\\devel\\Slicer_Trunk_D64-bin\\Slicer-build\\Slicer.exe '--launcher-no-splash' '--launcher-additional-settings' 'C:/devel/SlicerRT_D64-bin/inner-build/AdditionalLauncherSettings.ini' '--launch' 'C:/devel/SlicerRT_D64-bin/inner-build/bin/Debug/qSlicerDoseAccumulationModuleCxxTests.exe' 'qSlicerDoseAccumulationModuleGenericTest'

#### 2013-04-21, 20:35:08 - Csaba Pinter
Clean build didn't help, so it must be some small difference in the CMake files. I compared them to ones in other modules, but found nothing.

#### 2013-04-21, 21:01:25 - Franklin King

#### 2013-04-21, 21:07:34 - Csaba Pinter
The problem is at the generation of the CTestTestfile.cmake file (it's in SlicerRT_D64-bin\\inner-build\\DeformationFieldVisualizer\  esting\\Cxx). The problem is obvious if compared to for example SlicerRT_D64-bin\\inner-build\\DoseComparison\  esting\\Cxx\\CTestTestfile.cmake.

Investigating how it is generated.

Where did you copy the main CMakeLists.txt file when creating the module? I didn't try deleting those lines because I supposed that it came from a recent template. It's strange that it causes problems like this.

## #270 Deformation field visualizer slice glyph arrow tips sometimes oriented incorrectly
Vectors are projected to the selected image plane correctly, and the ribbon width is in the correct direction, but the arrow tips are rotated incorrectly and are not flush with the arrow shaft. Issue occurs due to the way the initial 2D glyphs are inconsistently oriented.

Mainly noticeable when magnitude of deformation is high. Generally occurs for whichever image plane has a normal of [1,0,0] (Green when testing with MRHead sample data).

I tried the module and it seems to do nothing at all. I set the inputs just like before, and the output volume is the same as the input. Have you tried it?

## #276 Deformation field visualization grid spacing should be uniform
The grid spacing currently is defined as the number of grid points along each axis of the deformation field volume. This is not ideal, because if the deformation field has anisotropic scaling and/or non-cubic shape then the grid will have non-cubic (non-square) cells. 

The grid spacing should be equal (cells should be cubic/square), because then it anisotropic scaling caused by a transform could be very well visualized. Also, currently the grid spacing is quite random, sometimes the grid is much more dense along one axis compared to the other, and there is no way to change that.

The user should be able to specify the grid spacing in millimeters.

In general the def field size will not be a multiple of the grid spacing. I would suggest to include only as many cells as it fits in the deformation field and center them in the field.

## #277 Deformation field visualizer color of contours and glyphs are not consistent
Generate a contour model. Generate a new model with glyphs. I would expect that glpyh colors are different on the two sides of the iso-magnitude surfaces/lines. However, it seems that the glyph colors don't change exactly along the contour lines (see the attached images)

## #278 Consolidate reference volume handling across modules
Contour conversion from model to labelmap needs a reference volume. In our modules that use contours, the reference volume is only needed when it is not already given.
But in the case of modules where we use more than one contours, this is more complicated. The labelmaps in this case should have the same lattice in the same coordinate system. So it is sometimes necessary to temporarily re-convert one of the contours for the operation in question.

Proposed solution: If the second input has a different lattice than the first one, then display a warning message saying that the second contour will be re-converted temporarily to match the geometry of the first one. On apply, the second contour is re-converted, that labelmap is used.

Question: Does it make sense to overwrite the original labelmap with the new one? Or should we just discard the new one keeping the original one in the second labelmap.

#### 2013-04-24, 15:16:52 - wangk
This also applies to situation when the contours are transformed. e.g. under a transform node. 

I think it is probably better to discard the newly resampled labelmaps. 

#### 2013-04-24, 15:18:29 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, applying a transform changes the coordinate system.

## #281 Change self test to use CLI modules without the wait cycles
Make use of the 2 new states in the CLI node status ('Cancelling' and 'Completing'). This gives the ability to scripted python modules to run CLIs without having to wait on them, option to cancel the cli, and most importantly, to be notified when the CLI is completed AND the outputs are loaded back into the scene.
The example below automatically assigns a color node to the generated output:
486   def runMergeLabels(self, run):
487     if run:
488       cliNode = self.getCLINode(slicer.modules.changelabel)

492       cliNode = slicer.cli.run(slicer.modules.changelabel, cliNode, parameters, wait_for_completion = False)
493     else:
494       cliNode = self.observer(self.StatusModifiedEvent, self.onMergeLabelsCLIModified)
495       self.get('MergeLabelsApplyPushButton').setEnabled(False)
496       cliNode.Cancel()

## #285 DCMTK_DIR not correctly sent to plastimatch
I just learned that recent versions of Slicer no longer have a DCMTK-install subdirectory.

But SlicerRT passes the DCMTK-install to plastimatch as DCMTK_DIR.

This means that plastimatch can't find DCMTK.

#### 2013-05-02, 18:14:54 - Greg Sharp
The directory structure within DCMTK-build is not consistent with existing versions of FindDCMTK.cmake.  This will require additional fixes within plastimatch to address that.

Steps to reproduce

(4) Drag contour node from 'Potential Heirarchy' onto patient node
(5) Slicer will crash

This was tested on linux.

Can you please elaborate on (1) and (2)?
Also can you tell me what version are you using?

#### 2013-05-17, 17:59:40 - Greg Sharp
Step (1) is just to create some hierarchy elements.
To be more concrete, please load 'Plastimatch random noise'.

You can skip (2).   Instead, on step (4), drag 'DefaultStructureSet' 
onto 'No description' underneath 'NOISE_PHANTOM'.

This is version 834 (svn HEAD).

#### 2013-05-17, 18:02:51 - Csaba Pinter

Hi Greg,

Thanks for reporting the bug. I took a quick look and found the problem which causes the crash. however, after I fixed this I found another issue. I think I will spend a bit more time to fix it. if you need a quick fix, you can just remove the RTPlanName variable in RTPlan class, that will get rid of the crash.

Thanks.

Andras & Greg
I have been thinking about this some more. I do think there is some merit in reporting a statistic from Gamma calculation.
If Slicer already calculates Gamma per Voxel, I would think it should not be a major hindrance to report some quantitative value.
For example one could report Gamma (avg) and percentage of voxels with Gamma < 1 ( pass) or Gamma > 1 (Fail)  at a user defined threshold.
Of course there are several papers out there which report such use. 
It’s easy for me to say but I suspect it is much harder to implement it. But I do think the dose comparison module is missing a quantitative value which a clinical user tends to look at first rather than just looking at a color wash map

The tolerance threshold investigated in #521 has a similar effect to this fuzzy approach.
It cannot be applied for inter-plane interpolation, and the in-plane 'fuzzification' does not seem to be worth the effort, so I close this as invalid.

Re #301: Allow fractional labelmap display information to be passed as field data. Current fields are: 'Min value', 'Max value', 'Interpolation mode', and 'Outline visible'.
Commit: r:3059|slicerrt:3059

#### 2016-08-17, 17:02:06 - Andras Lasso
Why do you have 'outline visible'? For fractional labelmaps the outline is the isosurface created at the threshold value (threshold value is 0 by default but we may make it adjustable by using another field data). The outline would be nicer than with binary labelmap but if it's not nice enough then maybe we could just add a hint that by default outline should be hidden.

I would suggest to put min/max values in one field, as it does not make sense to define only one and we also less fields is better. Making them double instead of string would allow us to get rid of a few conversions.

So, overall I would recommend these:
ScalarRange - vtkDoubleArray [2] = { minimumValue, maximumValue }
ImageInterpolationMethod - vtkStringArray [1], potential values 'NEAREST_NEIGHBOR', 'LINEAR', 'CUBIC', ... (or 'NearestNeighbor', 'Linear', 'Cubic')

#### 2016-08-17, 17:20:54 - Kyle Sunderland
@lassoan
In my previous implementation, I disabled the outline since the fractional outline isn't correctly rendered (it seems to be rendering many outlines around every value between 1-216). I'll change it so that the outline is only created at the threshold value.

So this means that the fields will be:
'ScalarRange' - vtkDoubleArray [2] = { minimumValue, maximumValue }
'ThresholdValue' - vtkDoubleArray [1] = {thresholdValue}
'ImageInterpolationMethod' - vtkIntArray [1] = VTK_CUBIC_INTERPOLATION, VTK_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION, VTK_NEAREST_INTERPOLATION

Does this seem acceptable?

#### 2016-08-17, 17:34:27 - Andras Lasso
Yes!
Using VTK_..._INTERPOLATION constants is a very good idea. As these constants are called 'InterpolationType' in VTK, let's call the field 'InterpolationType', too.

'ScalarRange' - vtkDoubleArray [2] = { minimumValue, maximumValue }
'ThresholdValue' - vtkDoubleArray [1] = {thresholdValue}
'InterpolationType' - vtkIntArray [1] = VTK_CUBIC_INTERPOLATION, VTK_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION, VTK_NEAREST_INTERPOLATION

Re #301: Modify vtkPolyDataToImageStencil as vtkFractionalPolyDataToImageStencil to increase conversion speed. The speed of the updated algorithm is as fast or faster than the multithreaded method.

@Sunderlandkyl I've just realized that for 2D fill probably we should use the thresholding filter output. That way the displayed contour would be filled - the same way as it is done for binary labelmaps. The segment would have clear, smooth, but non-blocky boundaries. What do you think?

#### 2016-08-27, 01:51:42 - Kyle Sunderland
@lassoan That sounds like an good idea. I'll implement it and see how it looks.

#### 2016-08-27, 02:00:12 - Csaba Pinter
I also think it's a good idea. We could add an option to switch between the two.
And even if the slice views show thresholded fill, the Data Probe can show the fractional values.

Guys,

I am thinking about what to do with this ticket, and I think I'll commit the small clean-up I made. here's why:

We need
1. MRML to ITK conversion - done in SlicerRtCommon
2. MRML to Plm conversion - done in PlmCommon
3. ITK to MRML conversion - no utility function for it
4. Resampling utility for MRML - done in vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility
5. ITK resampling utility - done in Plastimatch

The missing item is the ITK to MRML conversion. The problem with that is several modules do the same conversion internally (DoseComparison, ContourComparison, ExternalBeamPlanning, etc.), and they need different scalar types, which I don't know how to get from a templated pointer. Probably this is why Greg created the Plm_image class. I see two options here:
1. Don't create this utility (the conversion is about 10 lines of code anyway)
2. Create a Plm -> MRML conversion utility

Thoughts?

#### 2014-01-16, 13:56:22 - wangk
from what I understand, MRML to Plm conversion is just a quick way to get things working before we can do MRML to ITK conversion. although it is only 10 lines of code, I still think it is good idea and practice to have a utility function. Plm -> MRML conversion utility function option would be a bit sub-optimal as it means the code would be dependent on Plm library. I think we can probably push the ticket to 0.14 milestone to give us some more time to tackle the problem.

#### 2014-01-16, 14:47:11 - Greg Sharp
The MRML to Plm has advantage over MRML to ITK, because Plm_image handles different types (short, float, etc.).  Therefore, when using plastimatch, we can use this method.

If ITK is only used for calling plastimatch functions, maybe we don't need MRML to ITK conversion.  

Regarding Plm -> MRML, I agree this is valuable.

This should be agenda item on next meeting.

I gave it some more thought last night and I came to the same conclusion as Greg.
I think I'll implement a basic Plm->MRML utility function in two steps:
1. ITK->vtkImageData utility in this ticket (basically move it from external beam logic to a SlicerRtCommon and using it in the all the modules)
2. Create another ticket for the Plm->MRML conversion (the extra work is handling the volume geometry, for which I don't want to spend time before the release)
How does this sound?

@wangk:
We already have a good MRML to ITK.
ITK to MRML would be nice, but we (in SlicerRT) don't need that because we have Plastimatch (and I don't see parting from Plastimatch in the foreseeable future) that conceals the template complexity from us.

It would be nice to migrate these conversion utilities to Slicer, but consideing the difficulty of implementing an elegant ITK to MRML converter, and the sheer volume of the other integration work to the Slicer core I'm about to do, I would postpone this for now.

@pinter, your two step approach sounds good to me.

for now we use plastimatch exclusively, so MRML <-> Plm conversion would be enough for us at this point.. A more generic MRML <-> ITK would be nice in the future which can be migrated into slicer. I understand it will take a while to make it happen though.

#### 2014-01-16, 17:45:06 - Csaba Pinter
@gregsharp I created the conversion function (see rev 1422), and all the tests pass. However, ExternalBeamPlanning and PlastimatchPyLogic don't have automatic tests, so I cannot guarantee they work the same way. You can either test them, or hope for the best, or teach me about the usage of those modules at the next hangout so that I can try them until tests are created for those modules. Thanks!

## #305 Configuring inner with Plastimatch fails with certain CMake versions
I got this error with 2.8.10.2 when configuring SlicerRT:
'CMake Error: An attempt was made to access a variable: PLASTIMATCH_DIR that has not been defined. This variable is created by the FIND_PACKAGE command. CMake version 1.6 always converted the variable name to upper-case, but this behavior is no longer the case.  To fix this you might need to set the cache value of CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY to 1.6 or less.  If you are writing a CMake listfile, you should change the variable reference to use the case of the argument to FIND_PACKAGE'

Apparently this error doesn't come up using 2.8.11, not did I see it before. What is strange is that apparently no relevant code has been changed, and I didn't update my CMake for a while, and the builds have been fine until today. Maybe my CMake was somehow corrupted.

So fixing the issue is not absolutely necessary, but reading this message, it looks that using the variable name Plastimatch_DIR everywhere would be more consistent.

## #310 Patient Hierarchy crash (linux)
Steps to reproduce:

(1) Open Slicer
(2) Select PatientHierarchy

No messages in the console, just this:

Show module (name): 'Welcome' 
Show module (name): 'PatientHierarchy' 
error: [/home/gsharp/build/slicer-4/Slicer-build/Slicer-build/bin/./SlicerApp-real] exit abnormally - Report the problem.

Reproduced on a fresh checkout and fresh build of Slicer + SlicerRT @ Jun 9, 2013.

Debian testing (gcc 4.7.4).  Did not test on windows.

#### 2013-06-09, 20:09:09 - Csaba Pinter
I tried to reproduce on the linux I have (Ubuntu 12.04 64bit) when you first reported, with no luck.
I'm updating and building, and I'll try again.

#### 2013-06-09, 20:28:08 - Greg Sharp
The problem might not be localized to PatientHierarchy.   For example:

(1) rm -rf ~/.config/NA-MIC     // reset module path
(2) Open Slicer
(3) Choose 'Close scene' from menu
(4) Repeat (3) a few times
(5) Exit normally

Everything seems fine.

(1) Set module path to SlicerRT paths (cli-modules, qt-loadable, qt-scripted)
(2) Restart Slicer
(3) Choose 'Close scene' from menu   // Maybe do it 2 or 3 times
(4) Slicer crashes



#### 2013-06-09, 20:29:44 - Greg Sharp
I think if I disable modules selectively, I can find the one which causes the crash.  Is there an easy way to do this?

#### 2013-06-09, 20:36:00 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, you can uncheck modules in Edit Application Settings / Modules / Modules.

I'll try this Close scene crash, but it sounds like a separate issue.

#### 2013-06-09, 20:51:59 - Greg Sharp
I think it's related.  If I do this:


~~~~

cd SlicerRT-build/inner-build/lib/Slicer-4.2/qt-loadable-modules
rm -rf *PatientH* Python/*PatientH* *Dose* Python/*Dose*

~~~~


then the 'Close scene' crash goes away.

Thanks for the hint on disabling modules.  I will try that next.

This behavior is consistent with a memory access error during module startup.

#### 2013-06-09, 22:28:58 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for investigating!
Apparently the close scene crash right after startup is reproducible on Windows, so I can debug that tomorrow.

I think it could be a slicer bug.  With some effort I could find this:

(1) rm -rf ~/.config/NA-MIC // reset module path
(2) Open Slicer
(3) Choose 'Close scene' from menu a few times
(4) Choose 'Application settings' then cancel
(5) Repeat (3) and (4) until Slicer crashes.

#### 2013-06-11, 19:43:42 - Csaba Pinter

I did a clean build of Slicer rev22100 and SlicerRT rev900 and there is a crash when loading RT data and switching to Patient Hierarchy.

I still keep the debugger open, in case you want me to check value of any variable.  ;)

#### 2013-08-12, 18:52:52 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks, Greg! Please wait 10 more minutes if you can, I quickly take a look at the stack.

We should match our debugging method at the Wednesday hangout to see if I did something wrong when debugging that caused my empty stack. I successfully debugged Slicer on linux before doing it the same way, but one can never know.

#### 2013-08-13, 14:44:25 - Greg Sharp
The crash is in the call to SlicerRtCommon::PATIENTHIERARCHY_NODE_NAME_POSTFIX.size().  

At first I thought it could be issue of static initialization in dynamically loaded library.  But the object value is exactly same as automatic variable.  So it seems fully initialized.

Still investigating...

#### 2013-08-13, 15:50:45 - Greg Sharp
Not sure I made much progress, but I'm done for today.  Here's what I learned.

(1) The crash seems to occur for calling size() on other SlicerRtCommon std::string's.  For example, the following line of code crashes:


~~~~

int t = SlicerRtCommon::CONTOUR_CLOSED_SURFACE_MODEL_NODE_NAME_POSTFIX.size();  // crashes

~~~~


(2) If I create a class in the same translation unit (i.e. the same file), then equivalent code doesn't crash.  For example:


~~~~

const std::string qkkk = '_KKKKK';
class XXX {
public:
  static const std::string YYY;
};
const std::string XXX::YYY = '_XXXYYY';

...

// None of these cause a crash
const std::string q = '_PatientHierarchy';
int r = q.size();
int rkkk = qkkk.size();
int rxxx = XXX::YYY.size();

~~~~

(3) But when I move XXX::YYY to a different translation unit (such as SlicerRtCommon.cxx), then it crashes.

#### 2013-08-13, 16:15:33 - Csaba Pinter

I can't understand the reason right now, but I'll keep thinking.

## #313 Implement slicelet covering the gel dosimetry workflow
*Workflow:*
1. Start by loading a planning image (PLANCT) and a planned dose distribution (PLANDOSE), both 3D scalar dicom volumes. They share a common co-ordinate frame and are already registered.
2. Load an on-board imager cone beam CT scan (OBI) as a 3D scalar dicom volume, and register it to PLANCT.
3. Load a 3D optical CT scan of the gel, or a 2D scan of the film. (MEASURED). Format is 3D vff or a 2D picture format (eg. tiff, could be grayscale or RGB). Register MEASURED to OBI using fiducial marks.
4. Apply dose calibration curves (arbitrary scalar math operations) to MEASURED, yielding MEASUREDDOSE.
5. Perform a gamma, chi, etc. test between MEASUREDDOSE and PLANDOSE, yielding another 3D volume COMPARISON.
6. Extract statistics from COMPARISON.

sphere.SetRadius( 50 )
sphere.GetOutput().Update()
displayNode = slicer.vtkMRMLModelDisplayNode()
displayNode = slicer.mrmlScene.AddNode(displayNode) 
displayNode.SliceIntersectionVisibilityOn()
displayNode.VisibilityOn()
displayNode.SetBackfaceCulling(0)
modelNode = slicer.vtkMRMLModelNode()
modelNode=slicer.mrmlScene.AddNode(modelNode)

modelNode.SetModifiedSinceRead(1)
modelNode.SetAndObserveDisplayNodeID(displayNode.GetID())

## #315 Update dose color table when the isodose one is changed
Right now the color tables for the isodose and the dose distribution are tied in the sense that the default isodose color table is read from disk, and the dose one is generated from that automatically. It would be useful to have the dose color table follow it.

Tasks:
* Make a copy of the default isodose table for *each* dose distribution loaded and generate a dose color table for that (parameter set nodes are already created for each one)
* [DONE] Enable full editing of the isodose color table
** Make the dose one read-only as much as possible
* Create events and observers for changes in the isodose color tables and re-generate the corresponding dose color table
* Enable using percentages of prescribed dose as well as absolute values
* Use the Eclipse isodose colors as default (80% deep blue, 90% lighter warmer blue, 100% yellow, 105% orange, 110% red)

## #324 Plastimatch Dice requires values to be 1
The platimatch dice function doesn't work correctly if the label images have values other than one.  It should consider a voxel to be inside the structure for non-zero values.

@pinter I couldn't find anything obvious in plastimatch which would cause this.  How can I reproduce the problem?

#### 2013-08-26, 15:27:37 - Csaba Pinter
Looking at dice_statistics.cxx, it indeed looks like there is no bug at first glance.

You can reproduce the issue (if there still is one) by changing the last argument from true to false (or removing it) in the SlicerRtCommon::ConvertVolumeNodeToItkImage calls in the function vtkSlicerContourComparisonModuleLogicPrivate::GetInputContoursAsItkVolumes. At least this was the workaround that solved it back then.

I hope this helps.

As illustrated in the enclosed screenshot, build tree can be exported into the CMake package registry. As some point, the DCMTK build tree has probably been exported [1][2][3]. 

Since when building CTK, it is expected that there are no DCMTKConfig.cmake available, the first should be failing. In your case, it seems not to be failing because it resolves to that previous build added to the registery.
I would suggest to try adding the parameter 'NO_DEFAULT_PATH' to the FindDCMTK.cmake module available in CTK. See [4]

## #350 Split SlicerRtCommon into utility and constants
There are a lot of constants in SlicerRtCommon, while it also contains utility functions. It would be good to have a SlicerRtConstants class that contains these constants, and provides python wrapping for them.

Also probably move constants from common to their class of usage where no other class uses those

Change static members into static function so that they can be called from python (to avoid copy-paste errors and regressions when the constants are changed). Do it similarly to what was done in vtkMRMLSubjectHierarchyConstants:
  static const std::string GetSubjectHierarchyNodeNamePostfix()
    { return '_SubjectHierarchy'; };

@pzaffino @gregsharp
I reviewed the code of the Plastimatch wrapper and did two commits (1120, 1121). As Greg requested, here are my comments about the code for future reference, and also a short list of things to do:

* In case of vtkObjects subclasses SetObjectMacro has to be used instead of vtkSetMacro
* Unused code pieces can be deleted, the source repository has the whole history
* Error handling: the member variables that are used in the functions need to be checked of they are valid, because it can cause a crash if they are not. An error message needs to be logged too.
* Every C++ object that is initialized has to be deleted at some point. It is not enough to set the pointer to NULL.
* No need to use the Get function for reaching own members
* Coding conventions (http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Style_Guide), especially
** The variable names should indicate what they are. Examples: 'index' does not mean anything; inputVtkTransformation is an incorrect name for an object with vtkMatrix4x4 type
** Use this-> to indicate that the variable is a member (the code is easier to read)
** Local variable names should start with lower case
* Things that need to be changed (marked with 'TODO: ' in the source code
** Transformation names 'inputTransformation' or 'outputTransformation' are very dangerous. Please rename all of them to something like frame1Toframe2Transformation
(outputImageFromInputTransformation is a bit better but still not good as Image and Input are also ambiguous)
** GetOutputImage function name is quite bad as it does not actually return anything. Please rename the function and all its occurrences (e.g. in error messages)

Also I deleted some member variables that seemed to be used locally only (InputTransformation, WarpedImage, OutputTransformation). Please confirm that this was the case.

Subject: [slicer-users] Matlab access: Qt: Untested Windows version 6.2 detected!

I'm walking through this tutorial (http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/images/a/a7/MatlabBridgeTutorial.pdf) and I get an error at section 3.7.
The error reads:

Qt: Untested Windows version 6.2 detected!
Error: Application does NOT exists [C:/Users/Admin]

I think the problem is that the username is 'Admin Andrew' and Qt is choking on the space in between Admin and Andrew.  Is there a workaround for this?
I tried renaming the user account so that it didn't have any spaces, including editing the registry, but it broke some programs, so I reverted back to the original username.
I am running Windows 8 64 bit pro.

Thanks,

Nice progress. Some things to do:
* Give more unique node names: now Image shows up many times and there is no way to know which one we would like to select.Use the MultiDimension.Value value or the frame index in the name. Use the sequence metafile filename to generate a more meaningful root hierarchy node name (instead of just 'hierarchy').
* Only the root hierarchy node should contain MultiDimension.Name and MultiDimension.Unit attributes, the others should only contain MultiDimension.Value
* Change the MetafileImporter module's category from Examples to MultiDimension
* Register the MetafileImporter into the slicer data importers (so that when you drag-and-drop a mha file then you have the option to import it as a sequence metafile

I guess I'd just say 'Dimension Browser' (this already implies 'multi').    The data being browsed would be 'Multidimensional Data'.  by analogy I think a 'Dimension Hierarchy' would create a 'Multidimensional Data Structure'.

#### 2013-09-19, 02:32:41 - Andras Lasso
Very well done, Matthew. A few comments:
* Root node properties (parameter name, unit) should be editable using a simple editbox instead of a table. No need to show/edit the root node id.
* Sequence nodes: Add a node name column (since a recent commit the node names are nice). No need to show/edit the root node id. Add an 'Add' and 'Remove' button to this section (there should be some space for that on the right side).
* Data nodes: No need to show/edit the root node id. Node tags are not usually shown to the user, I think we should replace them by node type (vtkMRMLTransformNode).
* Sequenced node section is redundant. It should be removed and the unsequenced node list should be moved closer to the data nodes section.
* The vertical size of the sequence nodes section and unsequenced node list is too small. Change the size policy to allow dynamic extension up to about 15 rows.

Note that node ids are for internal use only, as Slicer may change them when a scene is loaded/imported (to guarantee uniqueness).

#### 2013-09-19, 14:30:08 - Andras Lasso
Two more things:
* After unhide the volume doesn’t show up in the slice viewer. Problem with display node? Maybe the rename hack should be applied (modify the node name to something to trigger a refresh in the slice viewer's list of volumes)?
* It would b nicer to have an eye icon in the data node table and the sequence table to unhide/hide nodes from editors

#### 2013-09-20, 20:43:21 - Matthew Holden
Regarding the volume nodes not appearing in the slice viewers after unhide, it seems like this behaviour is consistent with other volume nodes. If a node is added to the scene as hidden, it never appears in the slice viewers. If a node is added to the scene as unhidden, it always appears in the slice viewers. I haven't been able to find a way to 'update/refresh' the slice viewers to check if the hiddenness of the volume nodes has changed. I tried changing the MetafileImporter so it adds the volume nodes for the multi-dimension hierarchy to the scene as unhidden, and indeed, the volume nodes always appear in the slice viewer, even if they are hidden later.

#### 2013-09-20, 20:45:42 - Andras Lasso
I've found that if you change the name of the node then it triggers a refresh of the slice viewers' volume selector.

#### 2013-09-20, 21:10:29 - Andras Lasso
Minor comments:
* We could save some vertical space by placing Parameter Name and Unit editboxes in the same row
* Move eye icon to be the first column (to make it visible even when the node is long)
* Add eye icon to the sequence nodes list as well

#### 2013-09-20, 21:35:55 - Andras Lasso
I'm not sure about if the rename hack should work or not (in some cases it worked). Due to some optimization HideFromEditors property is not really changeable (http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=2906). We may request to change this behavior, if it's a blocking issue for us.

#### 2013-09-20, 21:44:39 - Andras Lasso
A solution that we might consider could be to create an internal scene, which a MultiDimension node would use internally to store all the nodes. When we want to show something in the primary scene then the node could be moved over from the internal scene to the primary scene. It would solve the HideFromEditors issue, the saving issue (now scene saving works only in .mrb format, due to hidden nodes not being saved), and performance optimization could be easier. Let's talk about this next week.

#### 2013-09-23, 15:38:12 - Matthew Holden
Thanks for the comments Andras. For the eye icon beside the sequence nodes, is this to show/hide the sequence node itself or to show/hide all the data nodes associated with that sequence node?

#### 2013-09-23, 16:43:27 - Andras Lasso

Could you please expose the 'SourceDataName' attribute values in the data nodes list? The SourceDataName value is used for finding corresponding data nodes between different timestamps, so it's kind of a 'role' that the node fulfills. The column should be displayed right after the Name column.

Thanks, it works perfectly! The data node table has become quite wide, so it's not very convenient to edit. Some layout change could be useful, such as:
* hide the right side (non-data nodes and left/right arrows) by default, as it is done in Application settings / Modules with the '>>' icon
* would be nicer to use the same left/right arrows as in the transforms module
* use the 'trashcan' and the '+ with the tree' from the annotation module for removing/adding sequence nodes (this one is not related, just would be nice and somewhat more consistent look&feel with other modules)

## #368 Create MultiDimension extension
The ParameterHierarchy was a name inspired by the implementation (we flatten the multi-dimensional space into a hierarchical tree), so it's not user-friendly and also confusing for the developers (it focuses on how the functionality is implemented instead of what the intention is).

So, the created extension skeleton and the loadable module inside should be renamed to MultiDimension.

Thanks! Please also:
* move the source code under a src subdirectory under MultiDimension
* rename LoadableModuleTemplate string in directory&file names and in all classes and cmake files to MultiDimension

I would like to change the parameter type from char* to std::string because it is both easier to work with and safer. The overhead should be negligible. Is there a reason why we were using char* as the parameter type in the first place? I will go ahead and make this change unless there are any objections.

#### 2013-07-29, 16:50:29 - Andras Lasso
In general, STL containers cannot be used on public class interfaces because they cannot be Python wrapped.
You can try to use std::string and see if Python wrapping works or not. If it works then you can use std::string instead of char* in public interfaces. If not, then you can still use it for private members You may also try to use vtkStdString class, maybe that can be wrapped.

Would be interesting also to ask this on the slicer-devel mailing list.

#### 2013-07-29, 17:07:54 - wangk
I used char* as it is easier to implement. as Andras suggested, if std:string can be wrapped then I think we can switch to it.

#### 2013-07-29, 17:34:12 - Matthew Holden
Python wrapping of std::string seems to work, but may be it would be best to use const char*. This would be more consistent with other vtk classes, including the vtkMRMLNode interface for attributes. Also, I re-read the VTK coding guidelines and my interpretation is that STL containers should be avoided in public class interfaces whenever possible.

#### 2013-08-08, 20:54:12 - Matthew Holden
I would like to standardize the language that we use to refer to various parts of the MultiDimension hierarchy. Much of the language we use at the moment refers to a time series of volumes. To generalize, I propose something like the following (see diagram https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/wiki/Multi-dimensonal_data_support):

[MyTimeSequence] -> Call it a RootNode
[MyTimeSequence_25.4] -> Call it a SequenceNode
[MultiDimensionDataConnector_1] -> Call it a DataConnectorNode
[VolumeNode25] -> Call it a DataNode
25.4 -> Call it a Value

I think this would make the interface for the MultiDimension module logic easier to use and the module itself easier to maintain. Terms like 'ChildNode' are ambiguous since there are several levels of hierarchy. So this would cause changes in the interface like: AddChildNodeAtTimePoint(...) becomes AddDataNodeAtValue(...),  RemoveChildNodeAtTimePoint(...) becomes RemoveSequenceNodeAtValue(...), etc.. I think these function names are more clear.

Of course, if you have better ideas for the naming convention, I'm happy to use those. What do you think?

#### 2013-08-09, 05:51:34 - Andras Lasso
This is an excellent proposition. Please also update the wiki page accordingly.

This is a continuous activity (placeholder for all commits into the sandbox). Is the 'Highest' priority intentional? Maybe it should be put into a 'Continuous' milestone or remove it if you don't like collector/placeholder tickets.

Yes, the continuous tickets can be identified as the ones with highest priority in the Future milestone. This way those are the uppermost ones.

We're not sure about it being related to  startup time as we can connect via putty fairly soon after matlab is started. 

However, you above suggestion does work. It we start Matlab manually, Slicer works ok. It's only when Slicer start Matlab that the problem occurs. As a workaround for now we can start it Matlab by hand

Please start Matlab and run the cli_commandserver.m script. Then start Slicer, go to the MatlabCommander module and run a Matlab command (e.g., 5*5).
=> Does the Matlab server report a client connection when the Matlab command is issued in Slicer?

#### 2013-08-07, 00:50:29 - Andras Lasso
Actually, most probably the issue was that wrong Matlab.exe was used.

...\\MATLAB\2013a\\bin\\matlab.exe: Matlab launcher, returns almost immediately after it starts Matlab, this should be used with the MatlabBridge
...\\MATLAB\2013a\\bin\\win64\\MATLAB.exe: Matlab executable that keeps blocking the caller process, this must not be used with the MatlabBridge if the 'Prefer Executable CLIs' Slicer option is enabled

If the Prefer Executable CLIs option is enabled: Even if the Matlab process is started as a detached process, it's still a child process and Slicer waits for the child process to terminate before the CLI module execution is considered to be complete. Therefore, if we wanted to make the MatlabBridge work even with ...\\bin\\win64\\MATLAB.exe then probably we would need to create an intermediate launcher process. That can be cmd.exe or another instance of the MatlabCommander, Slicer.exe, etc. (the intermediate process should exit as soon as it's launched Matlab).

Very good, now it shows up in the nightly build extension manager. It might be better to change the extension icon to show a 2D or 3D deformed grid, as the deformation field may be more recognizable (the icon is too small to see the glyphs).

## #378 3D glyph visualization crashes
When trying to visualize a simple linear transformation, the deformation field visualization module crashes

#### 2013-08-06, 07:58:01 - Franklin King
status: changed from "New" to "Accepted"

#### 2013-08-06, 08:05:54 - Franklin King
The crash occurs when reference volumes are large enough. Reducing the number of glyphs doesn't resolve the issue. 

#### 2013-08-06, 21:53:41 - Andras Lasso
The crash is due to the failed allocation in vtkDeformationFieldVisualizerGlyph3D::RequestData(...):

    output->Allocate(this->GetSource(0, inputVector[1]),
                     3*numPts*numSourceCells, numPts*numSourceCells);

For me it seems that there is a terrible inefficiency in the vtkDeformationFieldVisualizerGlyph3D.cxx: even if the max number of glyphs is set to 2000, most of the pipeline is performed for all the points of the image!!! The correct solution should be: generate 2000 random points and only process those points, never do any operation that processes all the points in the image.

#### 2013-08-07, 01:08:07 - Franklin King
I'll be reworking vtkDeformationFieldVisualizerGlyph3D/vtkTransformVisualizerGlyph3D (possibly in its entirety) since it's also the cause of issue #270. It's currently implemented as vtkGlyph3D with a couple additions haphazardly tacked on which is leading to a few issues.

That'll be great. Thanks!

## #384 Add support for Matlab R2009b
From: Alvaro Gomez
Sent: August 14, 2013 6:54 PM
To: Andras Lasso
Cc: Guillermo Carbajal
Subject: Re: MatlabBridge extension

Hi Andras,

When trying to use MatlabBridge with earlier versions of Matlab (2009a in Windows) we ran into some problems.
We could find a workaround that maybe could be useful for other people.
With this workaround we could run the Commander and the basic module created with the Module Generator.

1. Int64 arithmetics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
??? Undefined function or method 'times' for input arguments of type 'int64'.

Error in ==> cli_commandserver>convertFromUint8VectorToInt64 at 248
  result = sum(int64(uint8Vector).*int64(multipliers));

    parsedMsg.timestamp=convertFromUint8VectorToInt64(rawMsg(35:42));

Error in ==> cli_commandserver>ReadOpenIGTLinkMessage at 142
        msg=ParseOpenIGTLinkMessageHeader(headerData);

Error in ==> cli_commandserver>ReadOpenIGTLinkStringMessage at 124
    msg=ReadOpenIGTLinkMessage(clientSocket);

Error in ==> cli_commandserver at 73
        receivedMsg=ReadOpenIGTLinkStringMessage(clientSocketInfo);
can be used with earlier versions of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Int64 arithmetics is supported since (I think) MATLAB 2011b 

For earlier versions this package from File Exchange can be used with minor changes
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24725-int64-arithmetic-in-matlab
Changes:
a) (Only when compiling with gcc, no problem with visual studio) It has some problems with the use of pasting in some #define declarations when compiling the mex files with gcc. It can be fixed with this changes.

In  int64arithmetic/@int64/int64operation.c change line 38
c[i] = a[i] OPERATOR b[i];  //----original line---->// c[i] OPERATOR_EQ b[i];

In int64arithmetic/@uint64/uint64operation.c change line 46
c[i] = a[i] OPERATOR b[i];  //----original line---->// c[i] OPERATOR_EQ b[i];

b) It lacks a .m file
In int64arithmetic/@int64/ add a copy of the file colon.m with the name _colonobj.m
In int64arithmetic/@uint64/ add a copy of the file colon.m with the name _colonobj.m

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Another problem was: 

Line 183 of cli_imageread.m
[~,~,endian] = computer();
Ignoring output with '~' was introduced in (I think) MATLAB R2009b
We used instead something like:
[dummy1,dummy2,endian] = computer();

## #397 Vector field generation uneccessary for most cases
Current operation is that a vector field is generated after input is selected. This step is separated from the generation of the visualization.

The initial separate step for vector field generation can be avoided for all modes but the contour mode. Magnitude threshold for the glyph modes can be set by the user without knowledge of the min/max values. Generation of the entire vector field can also be avoided for glyph visualization relying instead on sampling only what's needed.

## #399 Support DICOM-RT export in Subject Hierarchy
Implement features that allow full exporting of DICOM-RT studies only from the Subject Hierarchy module.

* Export button under the tree which when clicked opens an Export window containing the SH tree with checkboxes for the nodes, DICOM tag editor widget for the selected node, and other necessary controls
* Edit DICOM tags
** Re-usable widget that allows editing DICOM tags (stored in prefixed node attributes) of a SH node
** This widget appears in a collapsed box under the SH tree, and also in the export pop-up
** Copy DICOM tags from (confirm overwrite)
*** Other SH node 
*** Series in DICOM database
* Export method in the plugin interface
** DICOM plugin could handle basic things like create study or append to existing study
** The other plugins that depend on DICOM can override the basic method exporting their supported objects (series only)
* In the long term there could be a generic Save function for saving locally (file or DB) and Export could be an uncontrolled export to anywhere

Hi Csaba - 

Would be good to coordinate with Alireza on this - he did the dicom header widget in CTK and we could make an editable version of that with extra functionality.  He'll be in SLC and we can go over this during the dicom breakout session.

-Steve

#### 2013-12-30, 15:10:52 - Csaba Pinter
I will definitely coordinate with him.

Which class is it in CTK? I'd like to take a look at it to see how the two concepts overlap and how they can be brought together. I have the fear that there are substantial differences in the two: header widget is a view for the DICOM header, and works on DICOM files, while the tags editor is a simple editor that works with MRML nodes. If so, then they can be one widget only if the DICOM browser can show MRML nodes too.

@gregsharp, actually I have developed a dicom plugin for registration object for our MRgRT project. Currently it can only import rigid transformation, not affine and deformable transformation. I could check in the code as experimental and you can give it a try. make sense?

#### 2013-09-03, 14:18:17 - Greg Sharp
Yes, I'd be glad to try it.

#### 2013-09-03, 15:26:57 - wangk
I think this plugin module should be in a separate extension as it is not only related to RT. for now I can check into SlicerRT repository just everybody can give it a try, or I should check into github?

#### 2013-09-03, 15:54:49 - Csaba Pinter
This should be a consensus decision involving all of us. Let's discuss it tomorrow at the hangout.

#### 2013-09-03, 15:57:15 - pieper
Hi Kevin, Greg - 

@fedorov and I are going to be working on registration objects (and other exotic dicom objects) as part of a new quantitative imaging grant (QIICR).  It would be great to collaborate with you on this.  Could you make your code available so we can look?  Github would be excellent, or SlicerRT if that's better.

Thanks,
Steve

#### 2013-09-03, 16:02:50 - wangk
Hi Csaba and Steve,

I think what I can do is that I can check in Github first, then tomorrow we can discuss if we include it in SlicerRT.

Thanks,

Kevin

#### 2013-09-03, 16:21:05 - Andrey Fedorov
I would like to join the hangout discussion tomorrow if possible - please let me know the details if it's ok.

#### 2013-09-03, 16:41:15 - wangk
Hi All,

I have created a Github repository for registration object import (https://github.com/kevinwangcanada/DICOMRegObject).

you can take a look at the code now so we can discuss tomorrow in more detail.

the only caveat right now is that python path cannot be set properly for the module. I did not have enough time to fix this. this is also true for the loadable module template. strangely enough, if you include another loadable module in the extension then everything is fine. We can also discuss this tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kevin

Also please always use a relatively new Slicer when you test your code, as this error is most probably due to the fact that you use a Slicer version that is at least weeks old.

#### 2014-02-18, 20:17:13 - wangk
i checked and it is ok to edit the color. but it doesnot update the color for the dose volume. 

#### 2014-02-18, 20:23:43 - Csaba Pinter
I'm not sure that it's something to expect. If the user changes the color table, then he should re-generate the isodose surfaces.
Changing the colors could make sense, but as we cannot handle a change in the number of levels dynamically, I think we shouldn't handle the color change either.
Or have you referred to something else?

#### 2014-02-18, 20:40:49 - jchris
Two remarks:
* While it makes sense to lock the color, is it possible to dynamically change the opacity ?
* Is it possible to 're-apply' without regenerating a set of isodoses ? Somehting like a in-place update.

#### 2014-02-18, 20:46:54 - Csaba Pinter
1. Opacity of the isosurface models can be changed like any other model, but not from the isodose module
2. Now it is not possible to update the already generated isodose surfaces with new properties. The user can delete the surfaces and create a new set. If it is needed, then a new ticket can be added, but usually we postpone feature requests like this until it is actually asked for by a user.

#### 2014-04-06, 02:27:41 - Csaba Pinter

@pinter, for the to do in the isodose test, I pick one level so it is simple and generic. if we want 2 levels or 3 levels, then we will have to fix that in the CMake Macro to supply 2 or 3 vtk polydata files as baseline. however, this can be done. what do you think?

@wangk I didn't see your comment, sorry!
So to answer it, I think 1 level is enough for now, as we only want to test how the isodose surface is calculated, and I think if anything changes in the code, then this test will fail no matter if 1 or 3 levels are generated.

It's very ugly if the node references are broken after scene load. Have you entered a bug in Mantis for Slicer?

#### 2013-09-22, 22:38:54 - Andras Lasso
The crash should be reported, too (if we use node references incorrectly then a meaningful error message should be logged instead of crashing).

#### 2013-09-22, 22:49:13 - Csaba Pinter
I sent a lengthy email to the slicer devel list about 2 hours ago, but apparently the system is slow.

#### 2013-09-22, 23:34:25 - pieper
HI Csaba - the mail got through.  I forwarded it to Alex and asked him to respond to you and cc the list.

There are many tests in vtkMRMLNodeTest1.cxx. It would be nice to add a test case that demonstrates the issue.

Also I did a minor code review of the module's code. Please see my changes and try to stick with those conventions. Also ask me if something is not clear or right. Thanks!

## #413 Direction cosines of exported RT dose is incorrrect sometimes
when the original direction cosine matrix is [-1 0 0; 0 -1 0; 0 0 -1], the exported RT dose has a direction cosine of [-1 0 0; 0 -1 0; 0 0 1]. after a bit investigation, it seems that it is the dicom tag 'grid frame offset vector' is not set correctly compared to the original dicom file. need more work on this.

## #414 Logic classes should not have a current parameter set node member
Now all logic classes contain a pointer to the 'currently selected' parameter set node as a member variable.

As the widget modifies the parameter set node when the user changes a UI setting, and the widget has direct access to the parameter set node, this is not necessary. Furthermore this structure implies that a logic class has a corresponding parameter set, which is not the case. A better solution would be:
* When the UI changes, the widget uses its own parameter set node accessor (i.e. the parameter set node combobox selection) instead of the logic
* The parameter set node gets passed to the logic on computation as the function argument of the computation function

Parameter node handling in modules (as established by looking at all the SlicerRT modules and coming up with best practices):
* Logic
** Get parameter node as computation function argument
* Widget
** setParameterNode
*** Select parameter node in combobox (in case it was not called through signal)
*** Set parameters from UI to new node if UI selection was valid but param node selection empty (NULL, etc.) \u000B+ updateButtonsState
*** qvtkReconnect Modified
*** updateWidgetFromMRML
** setMRMLScene + onEnter
*** qvtkReconnect SceneImportedEvent (setMRMLScene only)
*** Find parameters node or create it if there is no one in the scene (call setParameterNode)
** onSceneImportedEvent
*** onEnter

Re #415: Vinith assignment #3 tasks. Fixes are needed because REV module crashes when any parameter is modified.Individual commit messages below.

Changed the coordinate system names after checking with IEC standard and Room's Eye View module.

Fully functional orientation marker.

Created new model nodes of deep copy poly data to work on clone/harden/append workflow for orientation marker.

Fixed the transform variable redefinition error.

Added use of vtkTransformPolyData to work on getting the orientation marker updated as the geometric parameters are changed.

Added the ability to load custom 3D models from file directory. Also added option for BrainLab SRS array. Working on fixing transformation of orientation marker.

Added cloning of model poly data and hardening of transforms. Hardening transforms is currently commented out as it is causing some issues.

Implemented collision detection between additional devices and other components of machine.

Linac model is now displayed as human orientation marker, but model transformations still need to appear properly in marker.

Transformed both of the additional treatment models into their proper positions using the Harden Transform function.

Fixed issues with additional treatment model checkboxes and work-in progress for appending machine part models for orientation marker.

Added CMakeList.txt file and created applicator holder model.

Created electron applicator model. Hole on top plate must still be added.

Updated UI to account for KGH visits and to include applicator holder and electron applicator. Implemented additional transform for applicator models to existing hierarchy.

Added GUI skeleton for additional treatment models.

Re #845, re #415: Fixed gantry rotation + various fixes in REV and IEC logic

- Gantry rotation from Beams module is fixed by applying the 90 degrees rotation that goes from RAS to FixedReference. Note: This should be a new transform in the logic, as the whole linac needs to be transformed using this as well
- Duplication of definition of transform names removed by declaring static member variables for that in IEC logic and using them from REV logic
- Removed unnecessary error messages (setting NULL beam node is completely valid)
- Fixed typo in include directory variable name, which resulted in not being able to include IEC logic from REV logic
- Renamed CollimatorRotated coordinate system to Collimator. Reasons and concerns (also see TODOs added in the code):
It makes sense that there is a GantryToFixedReferenceTransform that goes from FixedReference to Gantry. Then there is CollimatorToGantryTransform, that goes from Gantry to Collimator. So far so good. Then the problems start:
1. The Collimator coordinate frame was called CollimatorRotated. (this has been renamed to Collimator, that’s how it makes sense, because one cannot go to a coordinate frame that does not exist, i.e. Collimator)
There are two more transforms, called CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform, and FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorRotatedTransform. If the rename from (1) is applied, then they are called CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform and FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorTransform. The problems here are
2. What is FixedReferenceIsocenter? It’s not in the coordinate system list. What do we use it for?
3. In the transform chain there is CollimatorToGantryTransform, under that FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorTransform, under that CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform. So this chain goes from Gantry -&gt; Collimator -&gt; FixedReferenceIsocenter -&gt; Collimator. This problem has been also explained in the code in:
vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::FIXEDREFERENCEISOCENTER_TO_COLLIMATORROTATED_TRANSFORM_NODE_NAME
vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::GetTransformBetween (fromFrame == Collimator &amp;&amp; toFrame == FixedReference)
vtkSlicerRoomsEyeViewModuleLogic::UpdateCollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform

Commit: r:3157|slicerrt:3157

#### 2017-05-02, 19:25:24 - Csaba Pinter
Fixes that are needed to do before closing this ticket:
  Generalize vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::GetTransformBetween, get rid of the 500 lines of if-else
    Take RAS to FixedReference into account [DONE]
    Couch movement should affect the whole linac instead of the couch\u000B(so that the patient that cannot move in RAS is always on the couch)
  BUG: Leak (33 vtkGeneralTransform, 6 vtkMatrix4x4, 2 vtkSimpleTransform, 4 vtkTransform)
  BUG: Close scene, logic gone, load models, crash
  BUG: Applicator holder appears in a different place after loading programmatically than when manually
  Take couch angle it into account for beam transform (need to fix GetTransformBetween first)
  Address TODOs around FIXEDREFERENCEISOCENTER_TO_COLLIMATORROTATED_TRANSFORM_NODE_NAME
These transforms are apparently responsible for the collimator rotation (they translate the collimator to the isocenter, rotate, then translate back). Need to do all this on the vtkTransform level

## #426 Consolidate error handling method in logic classes
There are several ways to handle errors right now in the code:
* Return with 0 on success, non-zero on error (Kevin's classes mostly)
* Have an std::string argument for errorMessage. If it is not empty, then there is an error and it is displayed on the module GUI
* Return with a bool success flag

It would be better to set a convention for this, e.g.:
Return bool success flags in every class, and have a string error message argument if it is needed to be displayed on the GUI.

## #428 Only raw xToTracker transforms are available in Slicer after sequence metafile import
By default only the raw xToTracker transforms are stored in the metafile, so you have to manually add the ImageToReference, NeedleToReference, etc. transforms to the metafile using the EditSeqMetafile tool (not complicated, just a few commands, but not very convenient).

A few options to solve this (none of them are perfect):
* add a module in Slicer that can invert/combine transforms as needed: still may require some additional manual configuration and specification of the calibration matrices
* with some heuristics create the needed transforms when the metafile is imported into Slicer: it could work for sequence metafiles generated by Plus, but not a generic solution

## #430 Hidden multidimensional data nodes are not saved
By default, imported nodes in the multidimensional data set are all hidden to not clutter the scene. However, Slicer does not offer hidden nodes for saving, therefore they are simply not saved.

If MRB format is chosen, then all nodes are saved, so that can be used as a workaround for now.

Options:
* Save the nodes when importing: wouls be simple, but the problem is that at that point we don't know where could we save the nodes (maybe the user won't want to save it at all), so not a good solution
* Implement the same behavior as for MRB format saving (hidden nodes are saved with the default settings): would be a nice solution, but requires Slicer core change and the current implementation around MRB saving is very kludgy
* Implement saving of the hidden multidimensional data nodes in the storage node of the root multidimensional node - probably this is the most feasible solution in the short term

## #433 Tilted plane contours are be loaded incorrectly
Andriy Fedorov:
'I am able to import these using SliceRT, but I am not sure they are visualized correctly (see the attached sagittal view, the contours 'ribbons' appear to be not aligned orthogonally with the imaging plane (see screenshot)'

The dataset in question is SlicerRt\\data\\oncentra-4.1.6-prostate-mr-tilted-plane

Proposed solution:
* When a structure is loaded and there is no CT (yet or otherwise), then show only the polylines of the contour (maybe with a tubefilter applied)
** Conversion to labelmap is usually not possible this way (disable the conversion?)
* When the corresponding CT is loaded, then get the normal and create the ribbons

I took a quick look at the code. I think the problem is at line 1014 in vtkSlicerDicomRtReader.cxx:

ribbonFilter->SetDefaultNormal(0,0,-1);

it assumes the normal to generate the ribbon is parallel to Z axis so if the images are titled, then it will not be correct. I think we need to check the referenced CT image to get the direction cosine so we can set the normal properly.

#### 2013-10-08, 16:19:48 - Csaba Pinter

By the way, it would be best to save the dicom ID information with the contour data.   For example, every scalar volume loaded from the DICOM module has an attribute instanceUIDs with one per slice which can be used to get the information from the dicomDatabase.  Since, as I understand it, contours can come from one of many different volumes or be created on the fly it's important to maintain the linkage. 

#### 2013-10-17, 19:36:23 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, we definitely want to maintain the links to the images used for contouring. What I don't know yet (I need to read upon it in the DICOM standard) is whether we should generate the ribbons based on each corresponding slice, or the normal vector of the slices will be the same. In the second case it might be enough to link to the anatomical images series, as it is currently done.

#### 2013-10-17, 19:44:18 - pieper
I don't know if it's common in RT but some acquisition types can have variable image orientation per-instance in a series.  E.g. free hand ultrasound or certain anatomy-following MRs.  Probably it's uncommon and other systems would break on that kind of RT data but I'd still think it's better to link the contours to the instances and not the series (less data loss since you can get to series from instance but not easily back).

#### 2013-10-31, 16:49:16 - Csaba Pinter
@pieper As I understand the instance UIDs for the scalar volumes are stored in the order the files came in to the reader. How can one use these UIDs without knowing which instance belongs to which slice?

I'm trying to make it possible to look up the CT slice instance for a particular ROI (closed planar) contour and the attribute approach does not seem to deliver this. At the moment I think a map from the ROI polydata cell index to the instance UID would solve the issue.

#### 2013-10-31, 19:53:35 - pieper
Hi Csaba (@pinter) - 

The mapping is well defined.  The instance UIDs are in the order of the slices in the vtkImageData (i.e. they are in 'k' order in ijk space).  The IJKToRAS information maps those to patient space.  So if you have any spot in world space you can get back to the instance UID of the source slice by mapping backwards through and transforms and then through the inverse of IJKToRAS.  Andrey and Nicole use this for the Reporting module.

-Steve

#### 2013-10-31, 20:02:31 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for the explanation, Steve! It seemed to me that the order is based on the order of the slice files.

#### 2013-10-31, 20:15:24 - pieper
Yes, it is based on the order of the slice files.  Slicer's scalar volume plugin sorts by image position patient and send the file list down to ITK which uses the first position to define the origin of IJTToRAS so the sorting should always match.

Re #435: Fixed structure registration. It was not aligned with the registered film and plan, because those were registered to each other in the original calibrated film coordinate frame which is arbitrary (because it was much simpler to keep an axial orientation due to numpy complexities with padding a non-axial array). Now the padding step (pre-processing before registration) considers the film orientation and does the padding correctly for all film orientations in the correct planes; Also, subject hierarchy is turned on when entering the film slicelet; Fixed module icon when installed

## #437 Fit polynomial on the calibration curve
Polynomial needs to be fit automatically on the calibration (optical density -> dose) curve.
Use the numpy polyfit function.

Mattea's description about this step:
'Substep 4/D)
1: Optical Density vs. Dose Curve: Display the optical density values and the associated dose values based on the calculation made in Substep C/3. The mean Optical density values from parsing of the vff should be along the y-axis and dose values calculated in Substep C/3 should be along along the x-axis. 
2: Based on the chart being show the user will input the order of the polynomial that would best fit the data. 
3: The desired polynomial is fit using the numpy polyfit. the x values sent are the dose values calculated in Substep C) 3:, the y values sent are the mean optical density values from the parsing of the vff, and the polynomial order is the one given by the user.'

Additional tasks:

Hi Csaba - 

I recently ported my LandmarkRegistration module from Annotations to Markups [1] - I think maybe you saw the demo of this at project week?  

I'm curious about the landmark registration steps discussed in this ticket - is it similar?  Is there a place you can point me to more info?

Thanks!

Hi Steve,

Yes I saw the demo and am aware of the this module. Is it same as what you used to call steered registration?

There are no documents or examples for the landmark registration in this slicelet yet. The slicelet is being developed for gel dosimetry analysis for the local hospital (KGH). It still in development and is kind of a prototype that we will refine based on their feedback. I added a screenshot here to illustrate what it looks like at the moment.

I made a note to myself to use your registration in the future, but I wasn't sure if it's ready to use, and the student who started working on the slicelet created this initial version which needed only some tune-up to make it fully working.

#### 2013-11-26, 13:35:25 - pieper
Hi Csaba - 

I'm still refactoring my steered registration code and working with Jc to get it in the nightly build.  My plan is to get this wrapped up this week.

It may be possible to use it in the gel dosimitry work - maybe we can do a mutual demo by hangout or at SLC and think about the options.

-Steve

Hi Steve,

In one of my projects we also use registration and I would like to see the demo. The current Brainsfit module is good for researchers but may not be well accepted by a clinical user. 

is it possible to have some discussion on the steered registration at SLC? maybe a breakout session?

Kevin

#### 2013-11-26, 14:09:57 - pieper
Hi Kevin -

We were going to have a project at SLC for this so I signed you guys up.  I put together a page for it with a link to a youtube video/demo.  It's not the best demo since the screen refresh is artificially slow but you should get the idea.  I hope to get this into the slicer nightlies soon.

#### 2013-11-26, 14:20:04 - wangk
Thanks Steve,

I think there are a lot of features in the steered registration that is essential for our registration project (and maybe for other people's registration project as well). let us discuss at SLC.

Kevin

#### 2013-11-26, 15:57:57 - Csaba Pinter
Hi Steve,

It is definitely possible to use it in the gel dosimetry slicelet. I just released it so the guys hopefully try it soon. I'll show them the youtube video about the steered registration and let them decide.

The reason I chose not to go that way is the nature of the images we have to register. I tried the steered registration on anatomical images, and it works really well with those (except when the orientation of the two volumes is different, because then it is really hard to find the matching landmark in the 'oblique' slice; it may be good to have an option in there to snap the slice viewers to the IJK orientation of the volumes - although this may be due to my complete lack of knowledge of the human anatomy except for those trifles that stuck on me while working in the field).
So I also tried it with the gel images that needed to be registered in the gel dosimetry workflow, and it was really hard to navigate in the volumes, as they are basically almost homogeneous smears with 6 glowing landmarks, which can only be seen on their slices, but I had no idea where they were if I was just one slice next to them. Also dragging the landmarks to their positions took me many more user interactions than just finding the slice and adding the fiducials by one click each.
So my impression was that the steered registration is very good for anatomical images with real features to see in them, but not so much in this case.

I can show you this on the NA-MIC week, maybe you'll have a suggestion how to work this out.

Thanks,
csaba

#### 2013-11-26, 20:19:04 - pieper
Yes, let's try it out when we get together.  Or if you want to send me pointers to the gel phantoms I could try.  There are some 'tricks' that I found helpful, like dragging the fiducial in one view to control the scrolling of the other two.  So if you are looking for the plane in axial where the fiducial is you could drag in the coronal to get the right slice and then move the fiducial in the axial view.  It's a little backward but maybe still useful.  

#### 2013-11-26, 20:41:37 - Csaba Pinter
The two volumes that we register are
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/SlicerRt/data/gel-dosimetry-01/Anon%20OBI
and
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/trunk/SlicerRt/data/gel-dosimetry-01/Opt%20CT%20Data/051513-01_HR.vff
(there is a VFF reader IO plugin in SlicerRT for the latter).

The problem with registering these images is that you just cannot decide which landmark belongs to which one, unless you know how you planted the BBs in the first place (for example the VFF is 'upside down' compared to the CT). The correct order of the landmarks (for reference) is like this (first set is the CT, second is the VFF file):
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(90.1, 156.9, -23.7)
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(130.6, 77, -23.7)
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(162.45, 94.1, -23.7)
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(89.6, 156.9, 51.5)
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(114.9, 77.4, 51.5)
    obiFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(161.4, 92.6, 51.5)
    measuredFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(-96.4, -29, 97.6)
    measuredFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(-15.3, -66.6, 97.6)
    measuredFiducialsNode.AddFiducial(-32.14, -98.73, 97.6)

## #441 Export fails if the contours contain only ribbon node
Export should work without manually converting the contours to labelmap.
Otherwise this exception happens:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3143581/screenshots/20131009_DicomRtExportFail.png

#### 2013-10-09, 19:26:42 - wangk
I found the reason why plastimatch complain about unmatched image sizes. after convert the contour to label map, 2 more slices are added to the label map. I am checking how to deal with this situation.

status: changed from "New" to "Accepted"

#### 2013-10-09, 19:41:50 - Csaba Pinter
Oh right! It is due to the fix Adam applied for ticket #161

#### 2013-10-09, 19:49:45 - Csaba Pinter
Basically the BODY contour spans the whole reference volume in the S-P (z) direction, and when it is converted to labelmap, one extra slice padding is added so that the labelmap to closed surface algorithm can 'close' the bottom and top of that contour. This is why the geometries do not match.

Maybe we can add a flag to the converter algorithm that specifies whether this expansion is done, and we can disable it for exporting. I think it is reasonable to expect from the user to specify a reference volume that actually covers the structures (otherwise the exported study won't be valid I guess)

@lassoan, @rankin, thoughts?

#### 2013-10-09, 19:52:03 - Adam Rankin
I think I did it wrong. The expanded extents should only be done for the closed surface conversion. It isn't necessary to pad for the labelmap as it can have the same extents as the reference volume.

#### 2013-10-09, 19:53:40 - wangk
that is what I am thinking. keep the label map the same extent, then only expand it when you want to generate the closed surface model.

#### 2013-10-09, 19:54:01 - Adam Rankin
In fact, should not the vtkMarchingCubes algorithm add any necessary padding?

#### 2013-10-09, 19:56:31 - Adam Rankin
I realize it's in Slicer core. Could extent padding be added as a parameter to the algorithm?

#### 2013-10-09, 19:56:56 - wangk
I do not think vtkMarchingCubes add any padding. 

#### 2013-10-09, 19:58:41 - Csaba Pinter
Apparently not, because we tried without the padding and the top and bottom part of the body was not closed that way (as far as I remember)

#### 2013-10-09, 20:00:27 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, maybe the good approach would be to only add the padding when actually creating the closed surface and then we could discard the expanded volume. This way we wouldn't need that flag (that would make the code more complicated)

#### 2013-10-09, 20:01:07 - Adam Rankin
It does not. I could modify the labelmap extents before sending it to the marching cubes algorithm if the boundaries are equal? This seems like a good solution.

#### 2013-10-09, 20:08:33 - pieper
The ModelMaker module does add a layer of pixels all around the label map before running marching cubes so that all the surfaces will be closed, and also adjusts the origin to account for this.  But it does this to a copy so the original label volume is unchanged.

@wangk Can you share with us what you found?

#### 2013-10-31, 15:49:10 - wangk
@rankin,, r:1223 fixed the issue however r:1224 re-introduced the issue. I think the right way to do this is what Steve decribed: make a temporary volume when converting polydata to labelmap, once you get the the temporary labelmap volume, then create the correct labelmap with original dimensions.

#### 2013-10-31, 16:01:41 - Csaba Pinter
Maybe we should only keep the intermediate labelmap (created when converting from ribbon directly to closed surface) if it didn't need to be expanded, otherwise we should discard it.

I think we can trust the user with selecting a reference volume that covers the contour when converting to labelmap. The only problem is that the closed surface will not be closed if any border voxel is foreground on the labelmap image. So we should either expand it automatically by 1 voxel to each direction when converting to closed surface, or trying to detect if any border voxel is foreground (might be costly).

#### 2013-10-31, 16:14:05 - wangk
Now that I looked at the code again more carefully. I think we should not expand the labelmap when converting polydata to labelmap. only create an expanded labelmap when converting from labelmap to closed surface on the fly.

#### 2013-10-31, 16:32:00 - wangk
I just reverted the vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter.cxx in SlicerRTCommon directory to r:1223 and was able to use dicom rt export module to export the example prostate dataset. what is the problem that r:1224 tried to fix? 

#### 2013-10-31, 16:41:36 - Csaba Pinter
I guess it was related to the fact that if any border voxels are foreground then marching cubes will result in an 'open' surface. So for example in case of the body contour where the bottom and top slices also contain contour data we need to exand the volume by 1 voxel in those directions so that we get a closed volume. Also this is why the exporting failed.

#### 2013-10-31, 16:43:02 - Csaba Pinter
Kevin, I agree with your comment (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/tickets/441-export-fails-if-the-contours-contain-only-ribbon-node?comment=393028403#comment:393028403), it is exactly what I wrote one comment above.

I am still not sure why we need to keep the padded labelmap instead of the original labelmap. I thought we only need to pad the labelmap before marchingcube algorithm and then we can discard the padded labelmap. Maybe we can discuss in weekly meeting to clarify the problem.

#### 2013-11-04, 17:39:10 - Csaba Pinter
Yes we should discuss it over the weekly meeting.

The reason I applied this fix is that, according to Andras, the converted indexed labelmaps should also contain the whole structure. This feature will be further enhanced in #452.

#### 2013-11-06, 16:40:18 - Adam Rankin
Both the labelmap and the closed surface are cut if the reference volume doesn't overlap the contour volume. I wrote the changes to only expand the reference area if the resulting transformed contour representation would be cut off.

What is the outstanding issue? The labelmap is expanded when it shouldn't be?

#### 2013-11-06, 16:57:21 - Csaba Pinter
I don't quite understand what your question about the outstanding issue refers to, but there are two things here:
1. Export fails if the labelmap dimensions are different from the reference dimensions. This is why it failed in case of every BODY contour because they are expanded (which is OK). I applied a temporary fix to make sure the exported labelmap has the right geometry. I think this part is alright until we have a proper way to export contours (without converting back and forth)
2. There is a bug in the expansion code due to comparing voxels to mms (see #452)

Did you find something that made you set this to accepted?

#### 2013-11-06, 17:02:35 - Csaba Pinter

I think I've fixed this None selection issue. Let me know if it still doesn't work as intended.

#### 2016-09-01, 17:02:59 - Greg Sharp
Sadly, it is not fixed.  The input markups dropdowns have no option for 'None.'  

Also, I note:

Output images do include option for 'None'.
Input images do not include option for 'None'.

#### 2016-09-01, 17:03:45 - Greg Sharp
Possibly the input images do not include option for 'None' because it uses index instead of longflag?


#### 2016-09-01, 17:06:25 - Andras Lasso
OK, I'll push a fix today.
Index arguments are required, so there will be no 'None' option for them.

#### 2016-09-01, 20:52:24 - Andras Lasso

## #445 Results for contour conversions with different resolutions 
This occurs within the Radiotherapy/Contours module.

When I attempt to covert an DICOM polyline contour into a an image (specfically, an indexed labelmap), it looks as if there is a centering issue that is more visible as one increases the oversampling factor.

When I use oversampling = 1, the voxels in the generated image appear to line up.  However, as I increase the oversampling factor, the labelmap image seems to converge on an offset that is one voxel off from the original image.  Please see the attached picture.

Labelmap and contour overlaid with oversampling = 8.

#### 2013-10-18, 14:28:38 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for reporting this! We recently made changes in the rasterization code, so I'll try it on the experimental version and get back to you.

#### 2013-10-18, 15:12:10 - Csaba Pinter
Indeed, there seems to be a shift in the oversampled labelmaps. This may explain the problem that lead to adding ticket #232. Good catch!

Thanks very much, Csaba!

Hi Adam,

I compile from source, and updated yesterday.  I did a fresh compile today, just in case, to verify that the above was still happening, and am currently at revision 1226.  Hope that helps, and feel free to let me know if you need any other feedback from my end.

## #446 Unify contour and its representations into a new refactored contour node
HideFromEditors flag prevents the representations from being saved, and thus being loaded. This makes some operations impossible (e.g. that rely on conversion of certain contour representations, such as DVH)

It seems that plmdose_config.h is not configured from plmdose_config.h.in. The strange thing is that the output configured file plmdose_config.h does not exist in my older release binary directories either. It may have been found in the debug directory somehow?

#### 2013-11-03, 15:18:55 - Csaba Pinter
@gregsharp I enabled plmdose regardless the status of the experimental modules. Apparently a new dependency has been introduced to the plmdose module so it is now used by the Plastimatch modules enabled for SlicerRT even without experimental modules.
If this is something that needs no further fix, then please remove the lines I commented out in revision 1249. However I'm concerned a bit because of the growing dependencies inside Plastimatch.

## #452 Contour conversion to labelmap cuts off the contour if oversampling factor is not 1
If the reference volume set to ribbon to labelmap conversion does not entirely cover the contour model, and the oversampling factor is not 1, then the expansion of the reference volume is not done.

#### 2013-11-04, 16:28:28 - Csaba Pinter
I believe the issue is at vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter::140, namely that the this->ReferenceImageData->GetExtent(referenceExtents); call gets the reference image extent in image IJK voxel space, but we need to get the boundaries in world RAS coordinate systems for both the poly data and the reference volume to be able to compare them properly.

#### 2013-11-06, 18:35:04 - Adam Rankin
I will use this ticket to track progress in doing a correct solution now that I understand the problem more.

status: changed from "New" to "Accepted"

#### 2013-11-06, 18:39:52 - Csaba Pinter
The most correct solution would be implement the vtkPolyDataToLabelmapFilter this way:
1. Get the contour boundaries in reference volume IJK coordinate system (vtkConvertContourRepresentations::GetTransformFromNodeToVolumeIjk)
2. Expand the got boundaries to completely engulf the reference volume
2a. Add a 1 voxel padding at the sides where the volume was not expanded due to the reference volume so that nothing is cut off when converting to closed surface model
3. Create the labelmap volume with the same directions and spacing as the reference volume, BUT a new origin and dimensions (that we computed in steps 1 and 2)

Probably it would be good to check the validity of the labelmap (same grid as the reference volume and all 0-valued bounadry voxels) when converting from labelmap to closed surface just to make sure.

If the user is allowed to edit the contour as a labelmap then it was useful to include the reference volume's full region in the labelmap. Otherwise the user may not be able to draw labels on the reference volume in some areas (that were outside the contour's original bounding box).

#### 2013-11-06, 18:50:39 - Csaba Pinter
OK, we can do that. However you said that the reference volume should only be used to get the directions and the spacing.

#### 2013-11-06, 18:54:32 - Andras Lasso
Yes. At that time I haven't thought about users wanting to draw structures outside the original bounding box. We should let the user draw freely within the reference volume's region.

#### 2013-11-06, 18:57:39 - Csaba Pinter
Makes sense, let's do it that way.

#### 2013-11-06, 19:16:35 - Csaba Pinter
Pop up warning message in a label when the result labelmap geometry differs from the refrence volume, like
'The labelmap had to be expanded to encompass the contour'

#### 2013-11-06, 20:05:41 - Andras Lasso
'Labelmap is larger than the reference volume' or something like that could be better, as it simply describes the present situation.

If we described an action then there can be many questions - when was that done? who did it? why? is it still relevant? can I undo it?...

#### 2013-11-06, 20:57:05 - Csaba Pinter
Well, yes, the message I proposed only makes sense if the user manually converted the contour to labelmap representation.

On the other hand the message you propose makes more sense if it happened in the background when the user was in another module, and then she selects a contour in the Contours module. In this case it is a 'state' mesage and not a message after the operation.
However, it is probably more acceptable than the 'operation result' message I wrote above.

## #456 Compute slice thickness from mandatory DICOM tags
Currently the optional SliceThickness (0018,0050) tag is used to get slice thickness from anatomical volumes for the ribbon width. However it is not always present and we also have seen incorrect values in it.

The correct approach would be to use ImagePositionPatient (0020,0032) and ImageOrientationPatient (0020,0037) tags to determine the actual slice thickness.
In case the thickness is not constant, we can log a warning and use the thickness from suitably chosen slices.

There are implementations for this in Slicer's scalar volume reader and also Plastimatch, maybe one can be used directly or parts of the code salvaged in SlicerRT

I updated the code and loaded the prostate phantom dataset. It seems that the thickness is not correctly applied (or computed, I don't know) on the contour.
It is possible that it's just a 'diameter-radius' kind of error.

(In r:1304|slicerrt:1304) Re #461: Created GelDosimetryAnalysisAlgo C++ loadable module to provide a logic class for the GelDosimetryAnalysis slicelet that can apply the computed polynomial on a volume.
NOTE: The module named GelDosimetryAnalysisLib could not be loaded at the same time as the GelDosimetryAnalysis, because there is some magic in the Slicer CMake scripts that renames modules ending with 'Lib' not to contain it (maybe because of EditorLib?). The bottom line is that I needed to rename it to GelDosimetryAnalysisAlgo

## #464 Make Matlab module debugging easier
Have an option in the Matlab commander to start a full-GUI matlab and add a breakpoint in the called function


## #465 Remove IJKtoRAS atrribute from Matlab image metadata
When an image is loaded using the MatlabBridge, currently IJKtoRAS information is stored in two places:
* in img.ijkToLpsTransform
* in a field in img.metaData

The field in img.metaData is not used, just left there, so remove it, and just keep the img.ijkToLpsTransform (and make sure the field is created in the written file)

Maybe also add an example describing how to get the spacing from the img.ijkToLpsTransform (and a note that directions shall not be ignored and add an example for getting LPS from IJK and IJK from LPS).


## #466 Create gel dosimetry self test that downloads the input data
Currently there is no proper self-test, but two methods, one which preforms the workflow using locally available data.

A proper self-test needs to be implemented, based on these basic test functions. The test data needs to be downloaded (there are already some datasets in the DataStore). Test parameters can be saved in a simple file that is attached to the tests and the variables read from them (e.g. CSV containing variable name, value pairs that is parsed).

Things to check besides the obvious:
* Visibility of scalar bar in gamma step (sliceAnnotations of layoutManager has scalar bar enabled)
* Mask segment is visible at gamma step

## #470 Automatically find a good window/level for the optical CT volumes
When the optical CT volumes (from the VFF files) are loaded, the window/level settings are far from ideal, homogeneous gray values can be seen.
It would be better to automatically assign good W/L settings:
* First try just to set the W/L to auto
* Do histogram analysis if the auto W/L doesn't work and set the W/L values based on predefined rules

## #471 Implement complete testing of GelDosimetry using any input data
Although there are test functions, they are in a temporary place and the input data details are hard-coded.
A proper self-test should be implemented:
* Use the SelfTest class
* Use an external file to specify the inputs
** MRML scene with already loaded DICOM data?
** XML containing file paths and DICOM UIDs and load them as the user would?
* Report registration errors and all quantified results (curve fitting error etc.)

Also fix the failing generic tests

#### 2013-12-12, 22:12:30 - Csaba Pinter
Hi Greg,

I have a few comments on the last commit you made.
The way the code is organized in PlastimatchPy/Logic is not consistent: there are two logic classes, one with a name matching the host module (vtkSlicerPlastimatchPyModuleLogic), and another completely different (plmpyDicomSroExport), while exercising well-defined functionality.

As PlastimatchPy is not intended for a specific purpose, rather a wrapper for python, and has no GUI, I think the best solution would be to have two classes in the Logic:
- vtkPlastimatchLandwarpRegistration (or something similar, that shows the wrapped functionality the best) with the contents of the current vtkSlicerPlastimatchPyModuleLogic. If it wraps more than one type of registration, it would be best to split it.
- vtkPlastimatchDicomSroExport. This will call plastimatch functions right? (if not, then it shouldn't be in this module at all)

Both classes should be direct subclasses of vtkObject or a VTK core class that fits its purpose best (for example if it would be some image operation, the base class should be vtkImageToImageFilter).
It may be needed to add an empty vtkSlicerPlastimatchPyModuleLogic class that is a proper Qt module logic class, just doing nothing (only if the SlicerMacroBuildModuleLogic needs it to be present, or there isn't another vtk cmake macro to build only the wrapper classes)

@gregsharp Is this considered done? If so, and if it is tested (the exported dataset successfully loaded in 3rd party sw), then it can be closed.
Thanks!

#### 2014-04-07, 19:40:46 - Greg Sharp
Not done.  Doesn't work.

The problem is that the MRML -> ITK converter changes the geometry of the image to include the registration.
Therefore the exported image already contains the transform described by the REG object.

We already agreed on a fix, which is adding a parameter for converting without including transform.  
But I didn't do it yet.  Let me take a crack at it now.

line 874:

fieldPtr[(i + j*(extent[1]+1) + k*(extent[1]+1)*(extent[3]+1))*3 + 1] = movingPoint_RAS[1] - fixedPoint_RAS[1];

i=137, j=84, k=3 - so, writing fieldPtr[249891], fieldPtr[249892], fieldPtr[249893]

The issue might be that the scalar type of this volume is not a float and you write float *fieldPtr = (float *)field->GetScalarPointer() - but I think this part of the code is obsolete anyway.

## #483 Devise a mechanism to recover from an accidentally deleted contour
Csaba mentioned that the undo button is not always reliable, so maybe we could come up with a way to safely retrieve a deleted contour.

Csaba:
'what occurred to me is maybe storing the active representation in the contours logic, outside the scene and showing a by default hidden button in the contours module to re-create deleted contour from saved representation'

We could warn people when exiting that deleted contours still exist, and do they want to exit without recovering them?

## #484 CMake warning for VffFileReader using CMake 2.8.12.1
It needs to be fixed (I don't really understand it):

CMake Warning (dev) in VffFileReader/CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0022 is not set: INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link
  interface.  Run 'cmake --help-policy CMP0022' for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  Target 'qSlicerVffFileReaderModule' has an INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
  property.  This should be preferred as the source of the link interface for
  this library but because CMP0022 is not set CMake is ignoring the property
  and using the link implementation as the link interface instead.
  INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES:
    qSlicerBaseQTApp;vtkSlicerVffFileReaderLogic;qSlicerVffFileReaderModule
  Link implementation:

The warning does not seem to appear any more (it was strange in the first place why there was a warning here and not other places, as the CMakeLists files use the same commands, there is no real difference in the VffFileReader one).

## #485 Allow manual association of anatomical volume and contour
If the user loads a structure set without having an associated CT or MRI in the same study, then the (arbitrary) default slice thickness is used, thus the contour is unusable, as it will contain either gaps (Guangming) or overlaps (Jidney), which make proper conversion to labelmap impossible. It should be possible to associate a contour (or a whole structure set) with an anatomical volume.

Possible solution:
Add this feature to the Subject Hierarchy RT plugin. When a contour is drag&dropped into a structure set under an anatomical volume (determined by modality), then take actions based on the active representation:
1. If ribbon, then re-ribbonize from the contour point data using the slice thickness of the parent volume. Invalidate all other representations
2: If labelmap or closed surface model, then (decide one of the followings):
  A: Just invalidate the ribbon model if available
  B: Switch to ribbon model if available and perform step 1, otherwise 2A.

Now that the contour thickness is determined using the actual contour ROI point data (#456), manual association of contour and volume just in order to get a slice thickness to use for the ribbon model is not necessary any more.

Moreover the ribbon model representation will be phased out once #103 is integrated.

## #487 Deformation direction is inverted
Deformation direction is inverted when using a bsplinetransform, see the attached image. Applicable for all transforms: Glyph, Grid, Block, Glyph Slice, Grid Slice. Transform & reference image available at #476.

Probably the correct solution would be to allow the user to choose the direction of the transform (moving->fixed or fixed->moving) and invert the transform if needed. Instead of actually inverting we may try to just invert the sign of the deformation vector and see how it looks.

## #488 Green contour level is missing
All green contours are missing. If I enter 1,2,3,4 for the values then they appear. For now at least the default levels should be set to 1,2,3,4, but the proper solution would be to synchronize the colormaps between different visualizations see #488.

Also, the 'values' label should be renamed to 'Iso-surface values (mm)'.

## #489 Color mapping should be synchronized for all visualization modes
For the same location the color is very different in different visualization modes (e.g., contour and glyph slice). Have a common manual setting for the color mapping that is applied to all modes.
It can be a simple textbox that accepts with 4 comma-separated values:

Displacement-color mapping: [1,2,3,5             ] mm -> negligible, low, medium, high

## #492 Glyph maximum radius values should have a larger range
Glyph maximum radius values should have a larger range, because sometimes with 1.0 radius they are still to thin (and if I increase the scaling factor then they become too long).
Probably 5-10 would be enough.

## #493 Grid, block, grid slice generated in incorrect locations
Grid, block, grid slice generated in incorrect locations when input is a displacement field (looks like mirrored or something). Other modes (glpyh, contour, glyph slice) look fine.
Reproducible with: http://sdrv.ms/Jx4j25

They are generated at various incorrect locations with a simple linear transform, too.
Reproducible with using the MRHead data as reference volume.

## #494 Possible memory leak in DoseAccumulation
Based on feedback https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/messages/3562103

#### 2013-12-18, 16:19:55 - Csaba Pinter
Based on Kevin's investigation it seems that a new patient hierarchy node is created for the accumulated volume regardless whether the output node already exists.
1. Kevin verifies if the problem disappears without this piece of code 
2. If it's verified I create a custom linux build for Gavin (temporary fix until the release of 0.13)
3. I fix this in the subject hierarchy branch and re-integrate the real fix along with it

#### 2013-12-19, 16:41:30 - wangk
I did a little test after commenting out the code which creates a new patient hierarchy node. It seems to be working. I run the module many times and the memory stays the same.

## #495 Failing test due to DicomRtExport module widget size
Automatic test fails due to a too large geometry returned by the DICOM-RT Export module widget:
'qSlicerDicomRtExportModule widget has a minimum size hint width of 1261px. It is wider than the max width of 500px.'

See for example: http://slicer.cdash.org/testDetails.php?test=4656682&build=178174

#### 2013-12-17, 20:32:19 - Greg Sharp
It appears to be some sort of limitation of the testing framework.  
Here is an excerpt from qSlicerDicomRtExportModuleWidgetGenericTest.cxx



~~~~

  // If the test fails here, there might be in the panel a GUI element (e.g. a
  // combobox, a push button...) with a too large minimum size hint.
  // Ideally this minimum size hint should be fixed, it is unlikely that such
  // large size hint is 'ideal'. Alternatively, you might want to investigate
  // the following:
  // Consider setting the horizontal size policy of such element to 'Ignored'
  // If the element is in a form layout, QFormLayout::layoutFieldGrowthPolicy
  // might need to be set to AllNonFixedFieldsGrow.
  // All those changes can be set from Qt Designer.

~~~~



I looked at the UI, and couldn't find anything special.  Nor could I reproduce 
the problem.  (Instead, Slicer crashes when I run the test.)

#### 2013-12-17, 22:14:59 - Csaba Pinter

A little more information.  Based on selective deletion of module files, I could find that at least one crash is related to be PatientHierarchy code.  

The stack trace is not very clear, but apparently related to Qt.

Thanks, Greg!

I'm very close to starting integrating the subject hierarchy branch into the trunk, which replaces patient hierarchy completely. If you don't mind I'll test this with subject hierarchy in the trunk.

I tried it on the stable 4.3.1, and it doesn't crash for me on Windows. Can you please try the stable on Linux? Thanks!

The problem is that the generated script file cannot find the Slicer launcher (that would then run the MatlabCommander module). Try to modify line 17 of /Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/Extensions-22599/MatlabModules/myTestSlicer
from
'$SLICER_HOME/Slicer' --launcher-no-splash --launch '$SLICER_MATLAB_COMMANDER_PATH' --call-matlab-function $MODULE_NAME $*

## #501 Implement roles in Subject Hierarchy plugins
* Plugins generate descriptive names: roles (how the plugin can handle the node)
** These names (role name, generated SH node name, confidence %) should be listed in the context menu instead of the plugin name
** A plugin can offer multiple ways to handle the same node (roles)
** Nodes need to store not just the owner plugin name but the role as well
** Roles assign levels to the nodes too
* Move role selection into sub-menu
** Slicer core change (MRMLTreeView pimpl constructor)
** Use saved tree view source files (20131223)
* Utilization
** RT dose: use the role (of the SH node) instead of the identifier attribute (in the volume)

After exploring the possibilities, it seems that the roles would have to have the same API as the plugins, extended by the new features mentioned in the description (descriptive names, levels), So the best option is to split the composite plugins (such as RT) to plugins corresponding to the role concepts, and augment their features to accommodate the needs.

Commit: r:1626|slicerrt:1626

#### 2014-04-08, 21:53:48 - jchris

Would it make sense to improve Slicer core and add the concept of 'Associated node' directly into vtkMRMLNode + update the vtkMRMLApplicationLogic so that associated nodes are automatically deleted ?

#### 2014-04-08, 22:00:26 - Csaba Pinter
What do you mean by directly into vtkMRMLNode? Its already there in the hierarchy nodes and there are utility functions to get everything.
But anyway, a mechanism like this would make a lot of sense, as you don't need the orphan hierarchy nodes in absence of the data node that was associated to them. I would wait with this until SH gets integrated into the core, as I introduced nested associations and it has to be handled too.

#### 2014-04-08, 22:05:54 - jchris



I means that the concept of association would be added to MRML Core or Logic. Methods like:

GetAssociatedSubjectHierarchyNode would then be changed into GetAssociatedNode. The helper method could be added to the scene.


Something along those lines. 


 I was just thinking loud 

#### 2014-04-08, 22:11:40 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, absolutely, it is a good idea. Now that hopefully SH will be an integral part of Slicer, and people will use it as a home module, these operations will become much more common.

I have a list of things to do in the core when integrating (nothing major :) ), I added this one too.

Thanks!

## #506 When 'Create contour' is selected in contour morphology, the referenceVolumeChanged is not called
When there is only one volume in the scene it is selected by default, but this->ContourMorphologyNode->GetReferenceVolumeNode() returns NULL.

This causes MorphContour() to fail.

It is most likely because I am not doing the correct workflow, but it seems like it should be correctly populated anyways.

More to it...

When I first load into Slicer and do the 'Create Contour', it does not auto-populate the reference volume, but when I delete the contour and re-add it, it is already defaulted onto the previously selected reference volume.

When I select the volume for the first time, qMRMLContourSelectorWidget::referenceVolumeNodeChanged(vtkMRMLNode* node) is not called

If 2008 64 bit c++ redist is required by Slicer, it should be installed with Slicer?

It should be provided by VS.
I'm not sure why you didn't have it, because for building anything 64bit you need to manually enable installing x64 tools in the VS setup process, and I guess it should add this too.

@pinter, I looked at the code in vtkConvertContourRepresentations::ConvertFromModelToIndexedLabelmap, especially in SlicerRtCommon::ConvertVolumeNodeToItkImage() where to conversion happens. I think the two functions are not doing the same thing. vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility::ResampleInputVolumeToReferenceVolume() resamples the input volume where the SlicerRtCommon::ConvertVolumeNodeToItkImage()  does not resample image, it just calculates the new direction cosine. and I think for now the consesus is that anything contour related should not be worked on as long as it works for now. Can we invalidate this ticket?

#### 2015-01-21, 18:58:45 - Csaba Pinter
Although I reported this ticket, I don't know much about it (it all came from a TODO in I guess Adam's code that seemed important). If you are sure that we don't need to use this function for the current implementation, then yes, please do so.
Thanks!

@Sunderlandkyl Next time please indicate the reason for such duplications in the commit message. If I saw such a message without explanation I'd think it's a bad move.
However in this case you discovered undeterministic behavior in ITK's dice algorithm and with the submission deadline coming fast you decided to quickly re-implement it because it's really simple.
Did you check ITK's code to try to understand the reason of the undeterminism?

## #528 Reading-writing sequences with thousands of data nodes is slow

Use the same approach as the volume archetype?

Is the problem the mha format?  I don't use it but isn't the 'a' for ascii and it's not a good format in general for images?

#### 2014-01-21, 13:53:41 - Andras Lasso
It's not mha but mrb: currently we store the private scene in the sequence node as an mrb file. Mha is at least a few times faster for images and of course much-much faster for transforms.

The overhead in creating an mrb file is probably the writing of each image/transform file to disk, then reading from the disk and zipping to disk, then deleting the files.

Probably we can keep this saving mechanism but need to add native formats as well (mha, nrrd, etc.) for performance and also compatibility reasons.

#### 2014-01-21, 13:55:36 - Andras Lasso
By the way, mha means 'archive' (when header and image is in the same file. While mhd refers to 'header' (when it's just a header; the image data is in a separate file). ASCII/bin encoding and compression flags are specified in the header.

#### 2014-01-21, 14:32:10 - pieper
Okay - makes sense.

But if the problem is the mrb and zipping, why not just stick with the unzipped mrml tree where everything is already separate files?

Or, if you still want the zip and don't care about the file format internally, how about making a storage node that is 'mrb-aware' and writes directly into the zip to avoid all the extra steps.

## #530 Allow editing of data nodes in a sequence
Currently when a data node is shown in the scene by the sequence browser module, some of the attributes (typically simple int, string values) are copied, while larger attributes (such as volumes, meshes, etc.) are referenced.
If the referenced data is changed in the scene then it is changed in the sequence node as well, this is good.
However, if the small attributes are changed in the scene then those changes are not saved into the sequence.

Need to have a two-way sync mechanism that updates the sequence node with any changes made in a browser output node; and that updates all browser output nodes if a data node in a sequence is changed.

Andras, I tested SequenceBrowser today with the prostate DCE dataset (the one available on the wiki that I shared with you earlier). Scrolling through time is noticeably slower than in MultiVolumeExplorer. Is the current version the re-architectured implementation, or you have not yet implemented the improvements you discussed at the project week?

Here is the script I used to create one scalar volume per frame from the DCE series imported from DICOM, in case this can save you few minutes:



~~~~


'''
 Helper function to extract frames from a multivolume one by
 one and add each frame as a separate scalar volume to the scene.
 Input: multivolume node and a reference scalar volume node that should
  have the same geometry as the multivolume.
'''
def explodeMultivolume(mvName, refName):
  mv = slicer.util.getNode(mvName)
  ref = slicer.util.getNode(refName)
  mvi = mv.GetImageData()

  for i in range(mv.GetNumberOfFrames()):
    e0 = vtk.vtkImageExtractComponents()
    e0.SetInput(mvi)
    e0.SetComponents(i)
    e0.Update()

    # clone reference
    frame = slicer.modules.volumes.logic().CloneVolume(slicer.mrmlScene, ref,'frame'+str(i))
    frame.SetAndObserveImageData(e0.GetOutput())


~~~~



#### 2014-02-05, 22:44:07 - Andras Lasso
Thanks for testing this. The browsing is indeed slower (with the multi-volume it takes 6 sec to play the whole sequence; with the multidimdata it takes 7sec if shown in one viewer and about 10 if shown in all 3 slice viewers).
There is no fundamental difference between how the volume is switched (no copying of pixels is done), so probably I just have to find and suppress a few unnecessary modification events to prevent extra updates. I'll have a look at this.

#### 2014-02-05, 22:55:57 - Andrey Fedorov
I guess I am not doing something right. When I try SequenceBrowser and just drag the slider manually, there is noticeable lag in updating the viewer (with just one viewer showing the sequence).

Commit: r:1494|slicerrt:1494

#### 2014-02-05, 23:06:32 - Andrey Fedorov
About 5 seconds.

Do you see any noticeable differences if you manually drag the slider in MultiVolumeExplorer vs SequenceBrowser for the prostate DCE dataset?

#### 2014-02-05, 23:10:36 - Andras Lasso
5 seconds is good, that should be about the same speed as the multivolume. For me at the beginning the slice browsing with multidimdata is immediate (I think the small patch that I've committed just now helps) and then it gets slower and slower. I have to investigate what causes the slowdown (maybe some observers get added at each iteration).

#### 2014-02-05, 23:23:27 - Andrey Fedorov
Note that in multivolume playback time for the whole sequence is constrained by the timer timeout, which is set to 50 ms (https://github.com/fedorov/MultiVolumeExplorer/blob/master/Py/qSlicerMultiVolumeExplorerModuleWidget.py#L23-L26), so for 60 frames it will take at least 3 seconds, independently of the actual data needed. I just tried to change the timeout to 1, and the playback time is about 2 sec.

A preliminary version of 'display tables' and roles is implemented in this CTK branch:

Andras pointed out an algorithm that starts with 2 opposing points arbitrarily then adds new polygon points by simply halving the distance, and keeps doing the splitting until the individual polygon segments have distance from the labelmap edge less than threshold.

## #537 Minor improvements in the Gel Dosimetry slicelet
* Apply registration on the structure set as well
** Select the structure set at step 2
* Apply 'slice intersection' in the 2D viewers for the crosshair
* Join steps 4A and 4B to be in one tab (easier access to the alignment after changing radius)
* Change OBI volume to green palette
* Turn on markup placement persistent mode

Bugs:
* Hide contours when starting the slicelet
* Change the cursor to indicate processing on gamma computation

Nice to have:
* Indicate better which volume is shown in the viewers

Tried to change size and position of the scalar bar programmatically, and could not find how. Changing the numbers in the following code has no effect at all:
    gammaScalarBarActor.SetPosition(0.1, 0.1)
    gammaScalarBarActor.SetWidth(0.1)
    gammaScalarBarActor.SetHeight(0.5)

Maybe the scalar bar widget has to be changed directly? (It would probably mean world coordinate magic which would be too much effort)

Our current standpoint is that we don't prevent the user from doing 'silly' things (Slicer playground VS fenced-around commercial softwares with few fixed workflows), but not let the program crash. We should just make sure the crash does not occur.

You mention drag dose under structure set. Is it something you consider a valid operation? Or were just fooling around?

By the way my version crashed when I dropped the dose under the structure set.

More information:

When a labelmap is created based on data that is not represented by 8bpp, there is a crash. Perhaps when the drag&drop onto a structure set is done, a live conversion from whatever the image is to an unsigned char type could be done?

The root of the difference is probably that the Y scaling that was used for the curve alignment was applied to the OD data and was reflected in the OD vs Dose curve, thus also the fitted polynomial.
Steps to take:
* Make sure only the X shift is applied
* Add Y shift for better visual alignment
* Allow the user to select a horizontal region in the aligned curves to be displayed in the OD vs Dose curve and be considered for the polynomial fitting
* Minor request: hide the beam model

## #545 Contour Module - 'Create New Module' leads to a crash
Problem has been identified using Slicer r22855 and SlicerRT r1478 in a Debug build. 
Details about the compiler and operating system are reported at the end of the ticket description.

Steps to reproduce:

# Ensruing the SlicerRt modules are loaded
# Go to Modules - >Radiotherapy -> Contours
# In selector, choose 'Create New Contour'
# It leads to a crash in function 'vtkMRMLContourNode::SetAndObserveRibbonModelNodeIdOnly()' as depicted on the enclosed screenshot.

From Csaba:
_The problem seems to be that the empty ribbon model node (default representation for new contours) is removed from the scene twice. The vtkSlicerContoursModuleLogic::ProcessMRMLSceneEvents shouldn't enter the part where the ribbon is deleted._

The contour name should not include any reference to representations, as a contour node contains *all* representations.

#### 2014-02-04, 21:29:40 - jchris
Exactly. Since the function takes a representation as a parameter and set the name of the contour considering the name of the representation, it is important to do the stripping.

Oh, I see now what you're doing (not append, but replace). Yes, this makes every sense.
I didn't add this because if you have a volume that you want to convert to contour, it usually doesn't contain the postfix. However, it absolutely can.

## #549 Ensure vtkMRMLContourNode::SetName maintain _Contour postfix and set representation name if required
The current implementation of vtkMRMLContourNode::SetName is (1) comparing if the provided name is different from the contour name and (2) only setting the representation names if contour name were different.

The proposed patch improve the function so that:
  - '_Contour' postfix is added if required
  - an attempt to set the representation names is always done independently of the state of the contour name

## #550 Add feature to create contour from representation outside the subject hierarchy
Many people are confused about how to create contours from representations: they try to just create a contour node in the combobox by clicking New, but that is only useful now if the user later creates the labelmap representation in the Editor module. We need a way to make it more intuitive.

Options:
1. Add import/inject representation feature in the Contours module (does not fit into the current definition of clean modules, where a module handles a certain type of node or performs one operation)
2. Create separate module for representation to mcontour conversion (escalates the 'swarm of small modules' problem)

re #550 WIP UI changes to Contours module added
Users can now create a contour from a representation through the Subject Hierarchy drag-and-drop mechanism or via the Contours module. Users can also right-click on an existing structure set and choose 'Create child contour from representation...' and they will be brought to the new UI components of the Contours module.

Dev: Currently encountering a cyclical linking issue. Current workaround is to have public members in the class to remove the need to link. Could use some advice about how to avoid this issue.

re #550 WIP code comment changes applied

actions are filtered by node information
Commit: r:1561|slicerrt:1561

#### 2014-03-07, 16:34:29 - Adam Rankin
So, the cyclical dependency is between the .dlls built by SlicerRt\\Contours and SlicerRt\\Contours\\Plugins.

What I do currently is set public variables (no functions to link against) in qSlicerContoursModuleWidget that I can then query in qSlicerContoursModuleWidget::onEnter to expand and set comboboxes as requested.

If I mark them as protected and add accessors, it fails to link (missing functions) and if I add the linkage to CMake, it notifies of a cyclical shared library dependency.

A couple of thoughts:
I could make them protected and make qSlicerSubjectHierarchyContourSetsPlugin a friend class of qSlicerContoursModuleWidget...

I could set some attributes in some sort of shared area... maybe in the structure set node itself? Then contours module could query all SS nodes to see if they've been requested to have a contour made...

When I convert a labelmap to a contour, then after clicking Create, the module shows a warning 'Selected source is already a representation for a contour'. I understand why it shows that, but I don't think seeing a warning message after a successful operation is a good thing. Maybe if you displayed a success message until the Source is changed, or set the Source combobox selection to None, then the warning wouldn't cause confusion.

Another thing is the Target Name. What is it? I entered a string and don't see it anywhere. Also we use sentence case ('Target Name' -> 'Target name')

Yet another is the Target Structure Set string. Please rename it to 'Target contour set'.

Thanks!

## #551 Vff reader might be unreasonable restrictive
When attempting to load a .vff file, Slicer reports the following errors:

... The value entered for the rank must be 3.
... The values for the origin must each be greater than or equal to 0.
... The value entered for the rawsize must be greater than or equal to 0.
... A string was not entered for Handle Scatter. The value must be separated from the parameter with an '='. The value entered for Handle Scatter must be factor.
... The value entered for the Reference Scatter Factor must be 1.
... The value entered for the Data Scatter Factor must be 1.
... A string was not entered for the filter. The value must be separated from the parameter with an '='. The value entered for the filter must be Ram-Lak.

However, I installed Microview and loaded them with no reported issues. I then exported them to DICOM and loaded that via Slicer successfully.

This would imply that the reported errors above are not errors but more warnings.

## #553 Use same logic in beams and external beam planning module
The current import logic supports only square beams, through the Beams module.

It would be ideal to use the new beams logic supporting MLCs that is implemented in External beam planning module (maybe separate it from it?).

Note: When this is done, then the RT plan plugin in SH should be reworked accordingly (handling beams, renaming to RT beams)

Update: After extensive discussion on this topic, we have decided to keep Beams module and move all the mrml and subjecthierarchyplugin into beams. also need to move the part of logic for beam visualization to beams from EBP. this way, beams logic can be called from DicomRtImportExport as well a EBP.

Happens with DICOM-RT export and Contour Comparison due to non-short image voxel type.

Csaba, what is the source of this bug?  I have a few hours tonight and can take a crack at it.

#### 2014-04-03, 22:34:16 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks!
The converter used to crash when met a float volume for DICOM-RT export or contour comparison (basically when feeding images to Plastimatch). Now a simple check is done and the conversion aborted when the scalar type (actually just the size of the scalar type) in the input VTK image is different from that of the ITK image that we created for output.
Haven't thought much about the possible proper solutions yet, but either we could somehow force the output ITK image to match the scalar type (maybe we should use Plm_image instead of a templated ITK pointer), or fix it at the points of calling the converter. I would prefer a solution that is done inside the converter, although it may not be entirely possible.

#### 2014-04-04, 12:18:33 - Greg Sharp
Got it.  I choose Plm_image method, since that is convenient for plastimatch interface.

Hi Csaba,  

Can you give me a little more information about the ContourComparison crash?  
The combobox only allows a contour type, so how can it be any type other than unsigned char?

#### 2014-04-04, 19:16:20 - Csaba Pinter
If the user has an int image that they convert to a contour, then the labelmap scalar type will be other than unsigned short. When the user chooses that contour for comparison, then the MRML to ITK converter cannot properly handle this scalar type, because an unsigned short ITK image is created in the contour comparison logic.

I see two options here:
1. Cast the image to unsigned short on converting to contour (vtkSlicerContoursModuleLogic::CreateContourFromRepresentation)
2. Use Plm_image everywhere instead of ITK image (contour comparison logic, SlicerRtCommon MRML to ITK converter)

@lassoan @rankin Thoughts?

#### 2014-04-04, 19:55:59 - Greg Sharp
Thank you Csaba.  I was able to reproduce the behavior.

There seems no harm in pursuing (2), and it even seems to make the logic a little simpler.  Therefore I will proceed along this course.

Idea (1) also seems maybe a good idea.  But I don't yet have clear picture.

#### 2014-04-04, 19:59:22 - Csaba Pinter
I'm OK with using Plm_image instead of ITK images wherever possible, as long as @lasso and @rankin are also OK with it.

However, when I make qSlicerContoursModulePlugins dependent on qSlicerContoursModule, I get a cyclic dependency error:

CMake Error: The inter-target dependency graph contains the following strongly connected component (cycle):
  'qSlicerContoursModule' of type SHARED_LIBRARY
    depends on 'qSlicerContoursModulePlugins' (weak)
  'qSlicerContoursModulePlugins' of type SHARED_LIBRARY
    depends on 'qSlicerContoursModule' (weak)
At least one of these targets is not a STATIC_LIBRARY.  Cyclic dependencies are allowed only among static libraries.

@pinter is it necessary to do dynamic_cast<> here?  If I use static_cast<>, it compiles fine.

I wonder if the right way to handle this is with SafeDownCast() macro?


#### 2014-03-09, 22:42:38 - jchris




Within Slicer, we have been using 'dynamic_cast'. For example, see [1]



This is required because the type of object returned by 'widgetRepresentation' method is a 'qSlicerAbstractModuleRepresentation' [2] that doesn't not derive from QObject or QWidget. (See [4] to understand why)




In case case, the object types to cast from/to are both of type QObject/QWidget, the macro 'qobject_cast' could be used.  See [3]. That would be the equivalent of 'SafeDownCast' existing in VTK.

@rankin, you can test the module using the sample data you uploaded. 

1.Load both CT images.
2.Load the DVF file. when loading the DVF file, turn on the show option and input (267,295,-325) as the grid origin. 
3.Apply the deformation transform to the dir image. 
4.Apply the post deformation transform to the deformation transform. 
Now the 2 CT images should be aligned.

Let me know if you have questions.

Hmm, a quick test might be load the .dvf, visualize it and see if it looks sane

It was a deformable registration from CT1 to CT2 (from LRCP random case)

#### 2014-08-07, 19:45:41 - wangk
I think I did a bit testing after I finished the module. but I think I will have to redo the testing again to make sure. the catch is that you need to use the option to set the origin of the grid transform when importing the data. so it needs a bit documentation.

#### 2014-08-07, 19:55:17 - Csaba Pinter
Not sure I understand correctly, but if there is an option that has to be used in most cases, then I think it would make senes to enable this option by default, and if the user encounters a file that is an exception in this manner then they will need to disable.
Not sure where to document this though as this is not a 'real' module. Maybe in the SlicerRT troubleshooting section (I don't think there is such a page but there should be)

Is this the one that I reported today? If yes, then the error is in the DICOM-RT export module, as I just drew on 3 slices and exported to DICOM.
I might be helpful to include the planes causing the error in the error message, so that we know what's wrong. Might not though...

Thanks Adam! The small synthetic dataset loads well now.

The first ARIA dataset is still not loaded perfectly. The slice thickness is set to 1. Can you check what causes this? The dataset should be acceptable and properly loadable as was exported by Eclipse. Also, please include the name of the contour in the error message, it's hard to see what caused the issue.

## #575 Item order and selection changes randomly in subject hierarchy tree
When showing/hiding certain nodes, the order of the nodes in that particular branch may change in a random manner. Sometimes selection changes too.

This problem occurs with the beam models in the Eclipse prostate phantom dataset, and all the volumes in the Huntington's longitudinal dataset. Video capture of the latter:
http://screencast.com/t/aQ4tRT52cK

These attempts did not make a difference:
* setting a SortingValue for the hierarchy nodes
* setting increasing numbers in an item role that I set as sortRole for the model

## #578 Segment using segment editor from subject hierarchy
Change Segment plugin to create new segmentation node for the selected volume if does not exist, put it in the same branch, switch to Segment Editor, and select the segmentation and the volume.
(Possible after integration into Slicer core, unless we create a new plugin)

Old description:
We have a create new child contour option in subject hierarchy, but the way one can create a segmentation using it is not straightforward, because the new contour will contain an empty ribbon model that the user has to first convert using a reference volume, then go to Editor module and draw on it there. What would be better is an action called 'Create and edit child contour...', that
0. Only appears for contour sets, and only if the contour set has a volume parent
1. Creates a contour similarly to how it is done in the existing feature
2. Assigns it the parent volume as reference volume
3. Creates an empty labelmap based on the reference volume
4. Switches to the Editor module and sets the new labelmap the current one to edit

Segmentation nodes are not required to be connected in any way to volume nodes (parent-child relation that the ticket mentions, or node references), so this context menu action is not viable any more.

There is already a Segment plugin in Slicer core that segments a non-labelmap volume and creates a labelmap volume using Editor. As segmentations will be supported by Editor, this 'Segment this using...' context menu action could create a segmentation and a new segment inside that is being edited in Editor when clicked.

## #580 Allow modifying isodose sets
Currently when the user clicks apply, a new set of isodose surfaces are generated. It would be better if the isodose set corresponding to the selected dose volume would be updated.
* Use a vtkMRMLSegmentationNode instead a hierarchy of model nodes. This step is debated. On one hand it may offer easier implementation, on the other hand isodose surfaces are not segmentations, so logically don't belong in one.
* Make sure the dose volume and the isodose segmentation reference each other
* When Apply is clicked, then check if an isodose set is referenced by the dose. If yes, then update it (keep the ones that did not change, remove the ones that did)

When this is ready, implement switching to the selected isodose set when edit properties is selected for the isodose segmentation in subject hierarchy.

Old description: 'It would be better to select a model (or subject) hierarchy node and overwrite the existing isodose surfaces with the new parameters (keep the models that have the same parameters, and remove the ones that  were changed).'

#### 2014-04-17, 18:31:59 - wangk
@pinter, this is a much needed feature. I was going through the isodose code this morning and I see the problem there. it would be nice to have a default model (or subject) hierarchy node automatically created if it is not there.

#### 2014-04-17, 18:48:54 - Csaba Pinter
I think we need to explicitly select/create a model or subject hierarchy node for the isodose set before creation in the isodose module UI. Similarly to Adam's create contour from representation panel in Contours, where we have to set the parent. If the parent is new, then another set is created, if it's a parent of an existing set, then it will be replaced.

With the new segmentations, isodose sets can be one Segmentation node each. The widget in Isodose module for handling isosurfaces (vtkSegments) will probably be identical to the one in the modified Editor module.
Much easier to implement the above way, so waiting for this feature would probably make sense.

Also why do you call the isodose hierarchy 'ISODOSE' with all caps? It's against the conventions, not to mention it's ugly.

#### 2015-11-16, 20:47:46 - Csaba Pinter
@wangk I have been trying to simply fix the error, but as I was reviewing the code, I found these problems. Please fix, or let me know if I should fix them.
1. Logic should not contain pointers to nodes related to input. Adding ModelHierarchyRootNode was a big mistake. We have parameter set nodes to contain information about the input, and the logic simply uses that data and executes its job. Input should not be strored in the logic. We have very clear design about this!
2. The isodose SH root node has always the same name, defined in ISODOSE_ROOT_SUBJECT_HIERARCHY_NODE_NAME. I already mentioned that the name itself does not compy to the conventions, but the problem is that the two involved hierarchy nodes are named completely differently. The SH node will always be called the same, while the model hierarchy node is named as it should be expected.
3. The code contains unnecessary lines and in many places the style is not according to conventions. I will fix this last one now.

#### 2015-11-16, 20:54:36 - wangk
will look at these things tomorrow or wednesday. I did remember the naming is a bit awkward so I will fix it. 

ModelHierarchyRootNode is not an input parameter. but I guess there is probably other way so that we do not need to keep it.

Thanks, Kevin! I fixed the naming so that should be fine now. I didn't have the chance to re-run the test but will do that tomorrow.
The model root node is indeed not an input, but not module-specific either and it does depend on the input. So it shouldn't be in the logic.

#### 2015-11-17, 15:46:15 - Csaba Pinter
@wangk Unfortunately there is a major bug in the new isodose logic. If you have two dose volumes, and try to generate isodose for both, then when you do it for the second dose, it removes the ones for the first dose. Please run IGRT self test and you'll understand. This needs fixing ASAP, as now the Slicer stable version also contains this bug. Thanks!

#### 2015-11-17, 16:00:02 - Csaba Pinter
I think the problem is that the ModelHierarchyRootNode member corresponds to the first dose volume and the nodes are removed around line 370 in the logic. This is why storing ModelHierarchyRootNode in the logic is a bad idea. It would be better to store it as a reference from the dose volume node (or the SH, whichever is more convenient).

Hi Csaba,

I tried to move the ModelHierarchyRootNode to the vtkMRMLIsodoseNode class as a reference, however, when looking at the IGRT test, I do not think you create a new vtkmrmlisedosenode when run the logic for the second time. so this will not fix the problem unless we create a new  vtkmrmlisedosenode for second run. 

now that I looked again at your comments and what do you mean by 'It would be better to store it as a reference from the dose volume node (or the SH, whichever is more convenient)'. can you advise please? 

#### 2015-11-18, 20:56:21 - wangk
and I think creating a new vtkMRMLIsodoseNode would be ok for second run of logic as it is supposed to keep all the input parameters. since in IGRT test, for second run, the input parameter is changed (which is the dose volume node) so it would be natural to create a new module parameter node and store dose volume node with the new parameter node. if so, then I will go ahead with this approach.

thanks.

#### 2015-11-18, 20:56:59 - Csaba Pinter
As you said, the model hierarchy node is not a direct input of the logic, so I don't think the parameter set node is the best to store this information. This is why I suggested to set the model hierarchy reference to the dose volume node. Does it make sense?

#### 2015-11-18, 21:14:31 - wangk
yes and no. since i think the design of parameter set node is to hold the input node which in this case is the dose volume node, this means that we should have 2 parameter set nodes for 2 different dose volume nodes. so naturally we should have 2 parameter set nodes. putting the reference in either of them would work. putting the reference in dose volume node has a bit advantage of convenient access to the reference from dose volume node. so i think i will go with this approach then. thanks.

#### 2015-11-18, 22:27:25 - Csaba Pinter
I agree that ideally the test should have two parameter set nodes.
Adding the reference to the dose volume node is indeed more convenient, but more importantly it allows finding the isodose set from the dose volume instead of looking for the parameter set node pointing to the dose volume, which is an expensive operation.

## #581 Create subject hierarchy documentation
Re-organize main SlicerRT wiki page, more links to small categories
** Modules, multi-column list
** Registration: Reg. case library, subject hierarchy reg. plugin
** Contour handling and segmentation
** Handling fractions
** Transforming studies, patients
** Beam handling (ask Kevin to write it)
** Plastimatch features (Greg)

Into Subject hierarchy module page
* Use labs page
* Screenshots
** Major features
** Plugins: offered options and results

Update montage: no whole screenshots, just viewers (no need for all those 2Ds)

I close this ticket, the subject hierarchy documentation now reflects the reality.
The SlicerRT page is not re-organized yet, because we will only see the complete picture when releasing 1.0 (after DICOM export, Segmentation object, and stable External beam planning), and can create a good documentation then.

## #582 Set best guess registration parameters based on input properties
Register plugin in subject hierarchy allows selecting two input volumes and the main registration method, which saves the user more than half the user interactions needed. However, more detailed parameter setting would be possible based on the image modalities and possibly other image properties.
These settings could be stored in parameter set nodes that are deployed in the SlicerRT install tree, and loaded on demand when certain conditions are met after selecting the two input volumes and the registration method.

## #583 Add closed surface / volume to planar contours conversion algorithm
Original title and description:
When a contour's poly data or volume data is transformed, the internal contour planes are not updated

The contour planes should be updated to reflect the new contour data.
This might require recalculation of the planes if the transform is deformable.

THe problem occurs when the transform is hardened. If we need the ROI contour points at a stage later than RT import, then we need to keep it updated. FOr now the planes and the ROI polylines are only used for the direct ROI to closed surface conversion, so not sure if this is needed in the future. Good to keep in mind though.

A reminder that every line of code that you write for 'sequence *', will become obsolete the moment multidimensional data is supported by subject hierarchy. Please read the wiki page about subject hierarchy and watch the 5-minute video so that you have  abasis to think about it while doing this work.
I'm writing this because any unnecessary work that is done is a waste of resources.

#### 2014-05-26, 19:53:22 - wangk
Hi Csaba,

I am not aware about the plan to migrate the multidimensional data support to subject hierarchy. Last week I talked to Andras and he think it is a good idea to develop all the python scripts for multidimensional data to test out the ideas before implementing them in C++. Maybe we should arrange a hangout to clarify? 

Thanks,
-Kevin

#### 2014-05-26, 19:57:17 - Csaba Pinter
It's not a short-term process, and I wasn't aware of your agreement with Andras. If a roadmap is established, then of course proceed. But eventually subject hierarchy should be the center of exploration and handling of any data.
Then the only thing I ask from you now is to read this wiki page
http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Labs/SubjectHierarchy
and watch this video
http://screencast.com/t/7fZ0eybAl
so that you can develop ideas as you go with the multidimension features.

Re #595: Fixed scene loading related issues;
Removed step that did a reset on the segment display properties when display node reference changed (it caused an assert fail in vtkMRMLLabelMapVolumeDisplayNode::UpdateImageDataPipeline because lookup table was empty before re-populating it). Removing this code should not cause issues, as the color table and the display properties are always synchronized with the segmentation, both when manipulating it real-time and when loading a scene. Also calling such high-level operations from low-level callback functions could cause other issues.

## #597 Contour 2D display in slice views
Need to come up with a good way to display multiple contours in the slice views.

#### 2014-05-14, 17:54:46 - Csaba Pinter
JC multiple slice view layers:
'Here is the topic: https://github.com/jcfr/Slicer/compare/add-multi-slice-layer-support
Need to do more testing and add support for VTK6.
Feature:
  * Associate a volume with a position N for each view independently
  * Simpler pipeline management introducing PipelineItem
  * Improve and simplify MRML reference system


Remarks:
  * The slice widget controller has not been updated to add/remove layer
  * 'Only' Available from either python/cpp
'

#### 2014-05-14, 17:54:57 - Csaba Pinter
JC:
'
Regarding the management of contours - there are few possible approaches:
 * One volume label per contour and then blending in the slice viewer using the multi layer support:
           Pros: 
              > Easy to hide/show contour and manage contour independently
              > Possible to have overlapping contour (lung and also tumor in the lung)
           Cons:
               > Increased memory usage. Eash contour will be associated with label map having the size of the original volume. Not aware of any 'smart' image container allowing to reduce the memory footprint.
               > When drawing a contour, will have to teach the brush to also delete on other label map
               > Volume rendering do not support multiple label map

 * One volume label for all contours:
            Pros:
              > Lower memory footprint
              > Already supported by current infrastructure
              > Easy to ensure there is no 'overlapping' contour
              > Volume rendering will render all contours (all labels within one label volume)
            Cons:
              > Hard to show/hide all contour at once. Threshold could be used.
'

#### 2014-05-14, 17:55:05 - Csaba Pinter
Contour management: We could do something in between the two main options. We could manage everything with only two labelmaps:
•         Binary labelmap that is currently being edited, it only contains one structure. 
•         RGB color layer containing a pre-computed composition of all the other contours (taking into account the color and transparency of each structure). The contours that are not being edited can be stored very efficiently with a simple run-length-encoding scheme (similarly as it is done in the Editor undo stack) or in any other representation (the new contour node already takes care of multiple representations and conversion between them) and they could be rendered directly from their compressed representation into the RGB image.

Andras

#### 2014-05-14, 18:13:03 - Adam Rankin
Yes, I completely agree, storing the contours in one shared labelmap is not a good approach. The fact that contours can overlap more-or-less excludes this option anyway.

 

I would only use a combined labelmap for display (that is dynamically constructed/updated by the 2D contour displayable manager).

 

Andras

#### 2014-07-31, 17:15:40 - Csaba Pinter
Recent state:
* Contour labelmaps still cannot be displayed in 2D views
* To make them work, the steps described below would be necessary (by Adam)
* There is no good and easy workaround either, so for the time being we allow easy creation of labelmeps from contours so that users can display them as volumes until segmentation node is done and integrated

'
vtkMRMLVolumeDisplayNode contain passthrough function to return vtkImageData of volume node when asked -> must be virtual so contour node can pass through its own vtkImageData instead

vtkMRMLSliceCompositeNode store vtkMRMLVolumeDisplayNode instead of vtkMRMLVolumeNode

vtkMRMLSliceLayerLogic store vtkMRMLVolumeDisplayNode instead of vtkMRMLVolumeNode

qMRMLSliceControllerWidget to work with vtkMRMLVolumeDisplayNode instead of vtkMRMLVolumeNode (when loading DICOM data, CT volume loaded as scalar volume did not show up)

re-enable vtkMRMLScalarVolumeDisplayNode subclassed to vtkMRMLContourVolumeDisplayNode

vtkMRMLSliceLayerLogic observing both transform modified and modified events
 - can this be done without identifying what type of node is present? I think so
vtkMRMLSliceLayerLogic contains most direct links to vtkMRMLVolumeNode direct access

The slice layer logic is where most of the re-writing would have to be done.

## #598 Subject hierarchy tree update issues
Tree collapses if nodes are added while the module is active

This is part of a more comprehensive issue with any updating the view, such as this problem Jc reported (mantis issue url:http://na-mic.org/Mantis/view.php?id=3714|#3714).
After a discussion with Julien and Jc at NA-MIC week, the following conclusion was drawn:
* The problem is caused by the faulty nodeIndex method in subject hierarchy scene model
* qMRMLSceneSubjectHierarchyModel::nodeIndex should be implemented so that it returns a good index regardless filtering (as though there was no proxy filter)
* Unit test has to be written that tests these cases
** Simple way to reproduce each issue is needed
** Use same PopulateScene method for all tests to make them test all scenarios on the same basis

Python script used to test subject hierarchy with a basic tree view (no filter proxy model, no fancy widget):
tv = qt.QTreeView()
wr = slicer.modules.subjecthierarchy.widgetRepresentation()
sm = wr.subjectHierarchySceneModel()
tv.setModel(sm)
tv.setDragEnabled(True)
tv.acceptDrops = 1
tv.show()

Fixed #598: Setting icons is not so simple as it should be due to a bug in Qt (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-20248), which raises the need to check if the icon to be set is the same as the current icon of an item. This introduces one more thing to remember to the subject hierarchy plugin developer. Thus, instead of having the plugins set icons on items, they just return it (or an empty one), and the model does the check. This way developing plugins is not harder than before.
Compiles with Slicer rev23489 and later.

## #600 ConvertVolumeNodeToItkImage cannot handle all transformed volumes

## #601 Support pre-clinical MR gel dosimetry workflow
Mattea at UofT works on the pre-clinical MR variant of the gel dosimetry workflow. It seems very similar to the one we support now, except for some input types and nomenclature.

Meeting minutes from 2014.05.22.
* No VFF but DICOM
** We could move the VFF loading UI parts to step 1 (rename it to 'Load data'), and add role selectors for the two volumes. Thus the calibration and measured volumes could come from both DICOM and VFF
** The alternative is to have different 'modes' for the slicelet, but that will get messy really soon (after having to add a third mode)
*** Probably on the long run if we have more 'modes', then we could have configuration files that the user loads up after startup, like a parameter set node that defines the inputs, axes names (see below), etc.
* Need to change the names on axes
** Optical density -> R1
* T1 map: signal intensity -> relaxation rate from multiple T2 time points
** Find out if t1 map computation is available in the 3rd party sw
* Send workflow chart to Mattea, she will mark the changes (for MR and general)

## #606 DICOM Rt Export fails when the labelmap padding causes inequal labelmap dimensions
Using the RANDO_ENT sample data in the RT sample data repo:

DICOM import study including ref volume, structure set, dose and plan
Proceed to DICOM Rt Export, choose valid choices, hit export.

Rt export reports failure due to image size mismatch.

I believe the essence of the problem to be the ribbon model of the BODY contour extends beyond the RAS bounds of the reference anatomy volume.

@lassoan suggested cropping the contours before export to ensure export was successful.

@gregsharp @pinter Thoughts?

#### 2014-06-02, 08:47:13 - Csaba Pinter
We met the same problem before, I wonder how come it is still problematic. The labelmaps are padded if the contour reaches the extent of the reference image, so that the stencil filter can work on them, thus the mismatch. Cropping sounds like a good idea, as the padding was performed for technical reasons only.
Did you find this on the trunk?

Latest everything with RANDO_ENT phantom results in a failure to export with the message:

You may be able to continue from this point, but results are undefined.

Suggested action is to save your work and restart.

If you have a repeatable sequence of steps that causes this message, please report the issue following instructions available at http://slicer.org


The message detail is:

They seem to be off by one border pixel, but when I look at the rasterized volumes, they coincide with the poly data perfectly.

I compared the contours in the testing folder with contours generated from pre-merge contours and they are the same.

## #614 Enable writing subject hierarchy plugins in python
The issue was discussed at the NA-MIC week (url:http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2014_Summer_Project_Week:Subject_hierarchy_integration|project). There seems to be two options:
1. Write adaptor C++ class, such as DirectoryListWidget in ExtensionWizard, or QTGUI\\qSlicerScriptedFileDialog; use setPythonSource for the plugins
2. Use signal/slot mechanism from a dummy scripted plugin VirtualPluginAdaptor, which emits signals that the python implementations can catch with their slots

Hi @pzaffino, the change you just committed broke SlicerRT and it says 'missing registration.h' when it is being compiled. you need to update the plastimatch revision number in 'SuperBuild/External_Plastimatch.cmake' when updating SlicerRT code. 

Also if you are working on this ticket, you can change the status to accepted and change the milestone.

Thanks,

SortingValue is the API that is used to determine node order within a branch, and it can be more or less used. The current commit in the topic branch enables moving nodes, but there are problems:
* Implementation of SortingValue is not consistent. In parenting the sorting values are handled as integers that can be increased freely, and in SetIndexInParent it is handled as a floating point value ranging from 0 to 1. Also I think the implementation of the latter is faulty. Fixing this mechanism is needed before this ticket can be fully addressed.
* Tree is not updating when order is changed, module needs to be switched and back, then the change appears. I could add back force update, but it not a good solution. Triggering a call of nodeIndex and using the SortingValue API would be a good solution, but for that fixing it is necessary (see above)
* Drag&drop is not possible with the current code, as reparent only considers nodes, ont indices or positions. This is not a huge issue though, as the move up/down buttons are satisfactory.

A working example is Models module via drag&drop. Need to investigate how it works there and implement in SH.

#### 2015-10-27, 16:44:36 - Csaba Pinter
Latest findings:
* Drag&drop in Models does not change either SortingValue or nodeIndex
* It seems to work only because the scene is never reset, and it does not work in SH because it is set to NULL on module exit and reset when re-enter

## #620 Select and drag&drop multiple nodes in subject hierarchy
To allow user to move nodes in subject hierarchy more quickly

This change affects
* CurrentNode stored in plugin handler
* Context menus (maybe just hide the select role sub-menu and only expose those of the basic actions that make sense)
* Reparenting obviously
* DICOM references (referenced nodes for all selected nodes should be highlighted)

The number of files to keep and the log file paths are stored in the revision settings. You can find a sample ini file attached. I reduced the number of files to 3 in my configuration for easier testing, but the default value is 10, which is defined in ctkFileLogger.

The log files are saved in the temp folder with file name Slicer_[revision]_[date]_[time].log. A sample log file is also attached. If the number of existing log files is larger than number of files to keep, then the old log file is deleted.
These logs start with some general information about the Slicer session: platform, OS, Slicer version and revision, date and time, followed by the VTK, Qt, and stream log entries.

## #626 Enable support of DICOM Segmentation Objects
Convert current implementation of vtkMRMLContourNode into vtkMRMLSegmentationNode by allowing multiple Segments per contour node.
Plans and progress wiki page: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/wiki/Segmentation

A segment is essentially a class wrapped around a list of vtkDataObject and some properties representing the details of that segment.

re #626: Fixed vtkSlicerSegmentationsModuleLogic::CreateLabelmapVolumeFromOrientedImageData

Fixed by setting a normalized vtkImageData in the MRML labelmap volume node.

How to test:
- Load rando^prostate CT
- Load rando^prostate RTSS
- Run this:
lmn=slicer.util.getNode('Femoral Head Lt_Labelmap')
id=lmn.GetImageData()
sl=slicer.modules.segmentations.logic()
nl=sl.CreateLabelmapVolumeFromOrientedImageData(id, 'nl')
- Select the new 'nl' labelmap node as labelmap, go to S: -54.5mm on the axial view to see the femur => femur head should show up in blue

Fixed #597, re #626: Labelmap merging and display works for segmentations; ExtentOffset member added to vtkOrientedImageData to store offset of the segment labelmap extents compared to reference (it takes a lot of computation to calculate it afterwards with the free orientation).

Re #626: Support methods for conversion parameters widget; There are two CreateRepresentation methods, both in vtkSegmentation (not in vtkSegmentationConverter, because it needs to know the master representation which is segmentation specific, and also to allow optimizations so that common things are not re-computed for each segment).

Re #626: Copy/move/import/export segment GUI and some of the logic; fixed minor bugs

Displayable manager does not call Modified on the representation before setting it as input to the pipeline as it triggers deletion of all other representations if it's the master
Show/hide segment hides the segment from the merged labelmap by setting the opacity for the color in the color table to zero. It does not trigger re-generation of merged labelmap, but if it would be desirable then it can be done later.

Re #626: Implemented copy/move segments between segmentations. Conversions are made for the added segment according to the following rules:
1. If the segment can be added (\\sa CanAcceptSegment), and it does
not contain the master representation, then the master representation is converted
using the cheapest available path.
2. Make sure that the segment contains the same types of representations that are
present in the existing segments of the segmentation (because we expect all segments
in a segmentation to contain the same types of representations).

Re #626: Added workaround for issue that segmentation node combobox does not select newly added segmentation nodes although the auto-select flag is enabled
Commit: r:2391|slicerrt:2391


## #627 Port the contour to surface conversion to C++ and use it in Segmentations
1. Port SlicerRt/sandbox/ContourInterpolation/src/ContoursToSurface.py to C++ and clean up
2. Verification of the ported algorithm using the same datasets we used, potential new ones too; Document failing scenarios, finding patterns (typical cases where it is expected to fail)
3. Use algorithm in Segmentations
* Create closed surface from the contours directly with the new class
* Ribbon model is no longer needed as a member variable
* Add option to create closed surface model through intermediate ribbon model and labelmap conversions to fix occasional failures of the new algorithm. Basically this action would do the same as the current implementation (except the ribbon model is immediately discarded after rasterization)
* Address ComplexityScalingFactor comments in vtkCalculateOversamplingFactor

Re #627: Use direct planar contours to closed surface conversion by default when loading DICOM-RT.

To fix: when converting to binary labelmap, the ribbon path is used because it is overall cheaper. However, the closed surface representation is already available and it would be faster that way (and ribbon would not be created unnecessarily this introducing inconsistency by using another model for labelmap conversion than what is displayed)

There are a couple of predefined hooks that you can choose from (see https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/vcs_hooks/all). Unfortunately, end-of-line checking is not available. You can submit your own hook and after it is reviewed it can be installed.

## #633 Use resample volume method in vtkSlicerVolumesLogic
The resample volume code in slicerRtCommon::vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility has been integrated into slicer trunk now. see: http://na-mic.org/Mantis/view.php?id=3753

need to change slicerrt code to use the new method in slicer volumes logic and retire vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility.


#### 2014-07-31, 14:53:27 - Adam Rankin
Just as an FYI this function has also been copy-pasted in SlicerRt to accept contour  nodes as well. Which should be updated to reflect any changes in the core function.

#### 2014-07-31, 15:49:40 - wangk
Thanks Adam for the info. Can you be more specific where it has been copy-pasted to? i.e. which module and which method.

vtkMRMLContourNode::ResampleInputContourNodeToReferenceVolumeNode

#### 2014-07-31, 16:01:44 - wangk
Thanks Adam. so the input node is a contour node and it is not clear to me how to update this. I guess we can leave it as is for now and discuss it at weekly meeting.

#### 2014-07-31, 16:40:33 - Adam Rankin
Copy-paste the code from core, replace input volume node with input contour node.

#### 2014-07-31, 16:59:10 - wangk
I see. I think it is better to create a separate ticket for that. do you want to work on updating vtkMRMLContourNode::ResampleInputContourNodeToReferenceVolumeNode method since you are more familiar with the contours module to better test it.

#### 2014-07-31, 17:22:53 - Adam Rankin
You cannot change one and not the other.

Please create a ticket for the contour change and list it as a parent to this bug.

#### 2014-07-31, 17:44:20 - wangk
i have created a ticket #634 and related it to this ticket.

#### 2014-07-31, 17:45:19 - Csaba Pinter
Is it possible to somehow use the core method as is with some wrapping added to the SlicerRT function? It would make this issue disappear (which is exactly why duplicating code is bad, but sometimes we don't have a better choice).

#### 2014-07-31, 17:47:30 - wangk
that is why I said I am not clear how to fix this now. the simple solution would be to duplicate the function which is bad. let us discuss at weekly meeting?

#### 2014-07-31, 17:54:09 - Csaba Pinter
OK

#### 2014-07-31, 18:18:12 - Adam Rankin
An option is to extract to labelmap, resample, then put the resampled details back into the original contour. A bit more overhead but no more code duplication. (Note, this triggers a bunch of MRML and scene updates)

#### 2014-08-01, 14:11:36 - wangk
to my surprise, there is no use of this method in SlicerRT currently. vtkMRMLContourNode::ResampleInputContourNodeToReferenceVolumeNode has been used in several contour related modules. 

After a bit investigation, I think doseacculation and dosecomparison modules can start to use this new method. doseaccumulation does resampling using its own code. dosecomparison has not resampling code, should we add resampling? I think it is logic.

status: changed from "New" to "Accepted"

#### 2014-08-01, 15:23:00 - Csaba Pinter
I agree. If a function is reliable and considered standard, that should be used. I think your method was used in contour related modules, but once the external labelmap node representations were replaced by the one contour node, that method could not be used as is any more.

#### 2014-08-01, 16:12:43 - Adam Rankin
Yes, the function was only used once in SlicerRt and when I changed the contours to no longer use a vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode, I needed the same function to operate on a vtkMRMLContourNode, so I duplicated it.

#### 2014-08-01, 16:17:15 - wangk
My preference is to update vtkMRMLContourNode::ResampleInputContourNodeToReferenceVolumeNode according to the changes in vtkSlicerVolumesLogic and keep using it until we figure out how to reuse part of the code. 

Regarding dose comparison module, do you guys agree we should make the 2 dose volume same geometry before comparison? it means that we need to apply the resample logic  in dose comparison module.

Thanks.

#### 2014-08-01, 16:18:56 - Csaba Pinter
Sounds fine. Let's update that duplicated function for the time being.

I think resampling for gamma is done in Plastimatch. @gregsharp Can you confirm?

for some unknown reason, the dicom rt import does not work for RTDose data with my latest slicer build. I am investigating but it can take some time. once it becomes functional, I will test it.

#### 2014-08-01, 19:11:04 - wangk
also I am waiting for @gregsharp to confirm there is already resampling in gamma analysis code.

#### 2014-08-01, 19:11:18 - Csaba Pinter

#### 2014-09-30, 00:10:48 - Adam Rankin
This needs more information. My function is a clone of vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility::ResampleInputVolumeNodeToReferenceVolumeNode accepting as input a ContourNode instead of a ScalarNode. The two should be kept in sync.

The reason this happens is because the needed function is in SlicerRt common, and we can't have SlicerRt common linking against the Contours module. If/when the Contour node moves into the core, then this will work because SlicerRtCommon can link against stuff in the core.

Sorry for the significant delay.

#### 2014-09-30, 00:15:55 - Adam Rankin
Oh, the reason it needs more information is that the function doesn't reflect a function in the core.

I only vaguely remember this discussion. Kevin had mentioned something about the functionality being moved to the core, but I still see the function in SlicerRt common.

bool vtkVolumesOrientedResampleUtility::ResampleInputVolumeNodeToReferenceVolumeNode(vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode* inVolumeNode, vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode* refVolumeNode, vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode* outVolumeNode)

due to the core function not knowing what a vtkMRMLContourNode is

I did a bit check. here is what I found out. the vtkOrientedResampleUtility class is not used anywhere in SlicerRt. so i think we can remove it now as the functionality has been put into slicer core vtkSlicerVolumesLogic class. I also checked the core function. it is exactly the same as the resample code in the contour node class. so there is no need to update the contour code. 

I think Adam's original idea is to use the function in vtkSlicerVolumesLogic to replace or at least replace some code in vtkMRMLContourNode::ResampleInputContourNodeToReferenceVolumeNode method. but this will need refactoring of the vtkSlicerVolumesLogic to make it happen. so I will just leave it as is for now.

if you guys are ok with just deleting vtkOrientedResampleUtility then I will just go head and then close this ticket.

## #636 Utilize scripted module base class for python modules
These modules are:
* DicomRtImportSelfTest
* DicomSroExport
* DvhComparison
* PlmMismatchError
* PlmRegister
* PlmVectorFieldAnalysis
* NAMIC_Tutorial_2013June_SelfTest

Description of the change
'
‘Enable developer mode’ flag is added to the Application settings dialog (Developer section) that can be used to show additional GUI elements when developing modules, do enable/disable more extensive logging, etc. It is used now to show/hide Reload&Test section in module widgets.


1. Summary of base classes

ScriptedLoadableModule:
•  Adds <MyModule>Test().runTest to Slicer self tests
ScriptedLoadableModuleWidget:
•  Contains a developerMode flag that indicates if Slicer is running in developer mode (in this case additional logging or GUI elements can be added).
•  Adds Reload&Test section to the module GUI if developer mode is enabled
ScriptedLoadableModuleLogic:
•  Contains delayDisplay convenience function
ScriptedLoadableModuleTest:
•  Contains delayDisplay convenience function

Source code of base classes:
https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/master/Base/Python/slicer/ScriptedLoadableModule.py


2. How to take advantage of these base classes in your own module?

Make those changes that are done in the scripted module template: https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/671595bbdaddb90ad2772bcff96686466126da4e#diff-436674d96f32037fcc8a863cfbcda62c
(import the base classes, specify the base class name in parentheses after each of your class names, in overridden methods call the base class implementation first, remove methods that are now provided in the base classes)

The new and simplified scripted module template that uses base classes:
https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/master/Extensions/Testing/ScriptedLoadableExtensionTemplate/ScriptedLoadableModuleTemplate/ScriptedLoadableModuleTemplate.py

After a bit investigation, I found the problem. it is in slicer trunk. when clone a volume node without a display node, it doesnot check if the display node is valid and copies it directly. I will add a ticket in mantis to report this. once it is fixed, then the test should pass.

in the mean time, if we dont want to wait until they fix that, then we can revert to older version. let me know what you think.

@jchris Here is the patch to cmake.

http://www.cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=bdb5007b

Slicer would need to (1) upgrade to cmake 3.1 on the Slicer factory, and (2) set a cmake option to enable.

https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/177


#### 2014-09-22, 19:26:53 - jchris


(1) is already done. The factory are already using CMake 3.0.1. 
See https://github.com/Slicer/DashboardScripts/commits/master


(2) For windows, seems we are all set. Is there a compile test that could be added to check the expected redistributable package is installed ? Or can we assume openmp is available if a pro version is used ?

Regarding MacOSx we may have to build the following project: http://clang-omp.github.io/

#### 2014-09-22, 20:06:39 - Greg Sharp
(1) My understanding is the patch will be included in 3.1, not 3.0.1.

(2) Good question.  A test might run post-packaging, and detect existence of library in zip file.  I'm willing to write the test, but I'm not sure where to hook it in.  Yes, openmp is always included in MSVC pro version (2008 and newer).  

(3) Are factories using clang compiler?

Was thinking about a configure test checking if the openmp library was available. That way we would be able to detect and warn the developer at configure time if anything is missing ...

On MacOSx clang is used. Clang is now the official compiler on MacOSX.

@mwelch Hi Mattea, do you happen to remember what this ticket was for? In case it was your request not the KGH crew's. Thanks!


## #650 Display dose map colorbar in 2D view
Right now, SlicerRT has the option to display colorbar for the isodose contours according to the Gy assigned to each one of them. However, when the dose map is displayed it would be also useful to see the association between colors in the map and the Gy values.

Important to consider that the colorbar must change when the window level is modified in RTDOSE volume display properties.

#### 2014-09-15, 13:11:10 - Csaba Pinter
Good point, thanks for adding this. Please note that isodose colors and dose map colors are tied, so this is a bit harder than it seems.

Hi,

I realized two things about this ticket. First, the  was already pointed out in #121. Second, Slicer can already display the scalar colorbar that adapts to changes in the window level (check the image I uploaded to this ticket file:Color_Scalar_Bar_Dose_Map.jpeg|Color Scalar Bar ).

Now, there are still some specific things that could be considered as issues or requirements:
   - Adding a label to Slicer scalar colorbar with the units (e.g. set on top of the bar a text with the units (Gy) )
   - There is no relation between the color table used for displaying the dose map and the color table used for displaying the isodoses. This could create some redundancy or confusion.

'- There is no relation between the color table used for displaying the dose map and the color table used for displaying the isodoses. This could create some redundancy or confusion.'
There is a relation, just not a dynamic one. Basically SlicerRT has an isodose color map that is loaded on startup. A dose color table is created from this isodose map when a dose volume is loaded. Unfortunately the two are not linked in a way that if one changes the other should too. This is covered in #315

#### 2014-10-06, 14:40:07 - rcorredorj
True, but maybe it is better to keep only this existing colorbar in Slicer, that is already dynamic, and adapt the isodose contour colors to those changes, am I wrong? why would you need the additional scalar colorbars for the isodose contours?

#### 2014-10-06, 14:41:25 - Csaba Pinter
Because it has to be manually changeable in the isodose module

#### 2014-10-06, 15:18:15 - rcorredorj
Ok, but it is not easier/better to change directly the color lookup table assigned for dose data by manually setting custom colors to specific values? For example, that is what I usually do in ParaView where it is possible to set a color and a opacity to a value in the data range, via a colormap widget http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/573. In that way, the color settings would be automatically reflected both in the dose map and the isodose colors, keeping the same scalar colorbar. (Only questions to understand better, but you have more experience than me in the field :-) ) Thanks @pinter !!

#### 2014-10-06, 15:24:37 - Csaba Pinter
Although the two color table nodes assign the same colors to the same levels, the isodose table has to be kept open for editing to the user who generates isodose surfaces. The dose volume color table is on the other hand contains a lot of color entries smoothing out these colors. The volume displayable manager can probably interpolate between the colors, so it is possible the isodose table can be used. What is for sure is that the current way is quite rigid and not even convenient. Unfortunately I cannot deal with this right now.

The best would be if you and @wangk came up with a specification-like document (Assembla wiki page) about the requirements that I and Andras also edit, and then we could come up with a design based on that.

#### 2014-10-06, 15:55:32 - rcorredorj
Sure @pinter ! My point of course is not to put you more work and push you more tickets :D It is specially to solve questions that help me to understand your decisions and hopefully part of these discussions would be useful (or not) to improve SlicerRT. I will try to see this point with @wangk, but at this moment it is still more important the beams module part. Thank you again!

#### 2014-10-06, 16:02:09 - Csaba Pinter
I didn't take it like that, no worries :) I think such a rough specification would be useful to get the ball rolling, even if your focus is different for now, because apparently you would rely on it, and have definite requirements in that matter. This part of the code is something that needs overhaul anyway. Thanks!

#### 2014-10-06, 17:52:20 - wangk
well. all are good points! 

a bit background for this scalarbar issue. when I first started to develop isodose module, we needed a scalarbar that can show the label as Gy value(e.g. 30 Gy) instead of color value 12 which has no physical meaning. that is why we developed our own scalarbar and later on this code was integrated into the slicer core. 

On another different project, some slicer developers have developed an enhanced scalarbar for dynamically updating according to current window/level setting, they based their implementation on the paraview's scalarbar. 

There was some discussion on how to integrate the two scalarbar into one but things more slowly and it has not happened so far. 

so in conclusion, you are right that we need features from both code. it just takes time.

Thanks, Greg! In the meantime I attended the developer hangout and according to Jc's quick investigation this is caused by a new OpenGL version used by VTK6 whose libraries are not properly packaged, so it's not a SlicerRT or Plastimatch issue most likely. He said he'd look into it later this week.

## #656 Contour created from labelmap isn't added to hierarchy
1 - Import sample DICOM-RT data (CT Image + RTStructs + Sample Dose map + RT Plan)
2 - Open 'Contours' module, select e.g. PTV, go into 'Change active representation', select 'Convert to: Indexed labelmap', keep CT as reference volume, oversampling factor 1 -> Apply.
3 - In the same module, in 'Contour functions', 'Extract labelmap from contour' -> Extract.
4 - After displaying the extracted labelmap in a 2D View, go into 'Editor' and edit the labelmap corresponding to PTV.
5 - After editing, come back to 'Contours' module. Go into 'create contour from representation', select as source the edited labelmap, select as parent the RTSTRUCT node already available, and set a custom contour name -> Create

With the current version of the code, the new contour node is not added into the hierarchy, the labelmap is deleted and new nodes are not inserted in the scene.

#### 2014-09-29, 18:03:41 - Csaba Pinter
This is intentional. In order to produce a valid ribbon model, we need consistent spacing. If the slice thicknesses are not uniform, then the ribbons (and so labelmaps created from those) are not valid.
This 'feature' should be deprecated once we integrate the direct ROI contours to closed surface algorithm.

#### 2014-09-29, 18:35:39 - Greg Sharp
The spacing is uniform.  But there is digital noise caused by encoding the float as a decimal string.

#### 2014-09-29, 18:55:37 - Csaba Pinter
Oh, I see, the two values are really close together. I can increase the threshold...

#### 2014-09-29, 21:15:50 - Csaba Pinter
There are other issues with the exported data, not just the rounding. It seems that two planes coincide, as your message also suggests with the slice thickness of 9.5057e-05.

Sure, I can put more decimals.

There are two contours on the same slice, that's what causes the coinciding contours.

You mean like branching?

#### 2014-09-29, 21:36:52 - Greg Sharp
Yeah, like branching.  I drew one contour on two slices, and then I drew two contours on the third slice.

#### 2014-09-29, 21:41:56 - Csaba Pinter
Well this makes sense. I guess I'll remove the constraint that doesn't allow two contours on the same plane.

@rankin: Do you think it's possible that we just didn't count with this scenario when we introduced this constraint? Were there some other resaon for it?

It seems reasonably safe to disregard the 0 spacing issue. One day we could make it smart and see if they link to the same anatomical slice?

Thanks! I'll remove this constraint for now.

Good idea! I don't think I'll implement it now though, I'm a little swamped, and the new ROI-surface algorithm will replace the current ribbon step (which we still keep for fallback scenario if the new one fails on some dataset - I'll probably add a button for that in Contours)

I also cannot display the contour on tilted planes. I think this is a limitation of Adam's changes.
A surface can be converted from the contour using this experimental module (PointWalk or Resample mode only, the new method somehow fails on this one):

No, I was wrong.  It is fixed.  I confirmed through the following steps:

(1) load rbergen test case
(2) draw a new contour on tilted slice
(3) DICOM-RT export
(4) Load in MIM
(5) Visually compare

However, the import of Slicer RT does not load correctly.

## #662 Structure set fails to load if there are multiple contours on the same slice
Diagnosis: Slice thickness is computed to be 0, if there are more zeroes (contours on same slice) than non-zeros, because that will be the majority value.
Solution: Ignore 0 as slice thickness, because it is not a real plane distance, it is a structure with multiple islands on the same slice (branching etc.)

#### 2014-10-14, 17:46:11 - Csaba Pinter
Fixed #662: Ignore 0 as slice thickness, because it is not a real plane distance, it is a structure with multiple islands on the same slice (branching etc.). This way these contours can be loaded and ribbons are displayed, as the majority value for slice thickness will never be 0, even if there are more co-planar contours than planes.

## #664 Plastimatch OpenMP disabled on Windows
This is a continuation of #647.  On Windows, the CMake < 3.1 does not bundle Visual Studio OpenMP library at time of packaging.  Therefore Plastimatch must be compiled without OpenMP to ensure that no load errors occur for end users.

This ticket should be closed when Slicer build machines upgrade their CMake version.

That would be fantastic.  Either dumpbin.exe or depends.exe could be used to see if the openmp dll is linked.  Below is an example.  Note that VCOMP120.DLL is linked.  

The test needs to be performed for a SlicerRT extension dll that was built on the kitware build computers, for example vtkSlicerSegmentComparisonModuleLogic.dll will use OpenMP to compute Dice.

Just for the future it would be useful if you included information such as platform, operating system version, etc.
For example I did a clean build of SlicerRT yesterday on Windows and it was OK...
Thanks!

#### 2014-11-05, 14:47:24 - maxime.desplanques
Sorry for that...
Here is the explanation:
This problem was an error with Windows 7 64bits, VS 2012. 
I added the library <functional> in vtkSlicerVffFileReader.cxx and it compiled fine afterwards.

#### 2014-11-05, 15:03:32 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for the fix!
So it seems to be related to VS 2012? Strange because I compiled it a few months ago with 2012 and VffFileReader hasn't change since then. I'm wondering why it failed for you...


## #667 Set color to exported RT structures
Every structure is black when exported

#### 2014-11-05, 17:19:17 - Csaba Pinter
You can get the color of a contour with vtkMRMLContourNode::GetColor
Let me know if it doesn't work well for some reason, the contours part is sort of under construction.

#### 2014-11-21, 00:13:00 - Greg Sharp
I tried to use vtkMRMLContourNode::GetColor, but all the colors are gray.  See #680.
Here is what I tried:


~~~~

for (each contourNode) {
  ...
  char *labelmapName = contourNode->GetName();
  double labelmapColor[4] = {1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0};
  int colorIndex;
  vtkMRMLColorTableNode *colorNode;
  contourNode->GetColor(colorIndex,colorNode);
  printf ('>>> labelmapName = %s\
', labelmapName);
  printf ('>>> colorIndex = %d\
', colorIndex);
  printf ('>>> colorNode = %p\
', colorNode);
  if (colorNode) {
      printf ('>>> colorNodeType = %d\
', colorNode->GetType());
      printf ('>>> colorNodeString = %s\
', colorNode->GetTypeAsString());
      colorNode->GetColor (1, labelmapColor);
      printf ('>>> color = %g %g %g %g\
', labelmapColor[0],
          labelmapColor[1], labelmapColor[2], labelmapColor[3]);
   }
}


~~~~


Which gives this:


~~~~

>>> labelmapName = BODY_Contour
>>> colorIndex = 1
>>> colorNode = 0x672cd30
>>> colorNodeType = 13
>>> colorNodeString = UserDefined
>>> color = 0.501961 0.501961 0.501961 1
>>> labelmapName = Bladder_Contour
>>> colorIndex = 1
>>> colorNode = 0x672cd30
>>> colorNodeType = 13

#### 2014-11-21, 00:20:07 - Greg Sharp
OK, I see the problem, but don't know what was intended.  What means the comment at line 682?

  if (colorIndex == SlicerRtCommon::COLOR_INDEX_INVALID)

    return;
  }

#### 2014-11-21, 00:29:43 - Csaba Pinter
As I remember it was supposed to speed up the method in some cases, as many times we only need the color node, not the color.

Hi Greg,
I tested the export and although there is color, they the RGB components seem to be messed up. Instead of red, I get blue, instead of light green, I get a peach-like color. Can you please check?
Also it looks that the dose file name is wrong. The exported file is now called
'dose.dcm_1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.274.1.1.7918762549.93216.6711654514.555'
I think the .dcm extnsion was inserted at the wrong location and it should be 'dose_1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.274.1.1.7918762549.93216.6711654514.555.dcm' instead.

#### 2015-04-08, 16:28:18 - Csaba Pinter
The color issue I reported above was probably due to erroneous handling of color tables (either when addind/removing contour or when extracting color for export).
Will not fix as segmentations is going to replace the whole contours infrastructure in several weeks now.

#### 2015-04-08, 16:29:05 - Csaba Pinter

@gregsharp Do you think it would be hard to add these tags to the exported files? One of our new projects involves exporting RT, and at least the specified six tags would be ultimately necessary. Thank you!

Re #668: Fix inconsistency between scalar volume and RT object DICOM load. In the Slicer core implementation (DICOMPlugin.py) the study instance UID and study ID are set as attributes to the study SH node, but in SlicerRT these were not set. So it depended on the (non-deterministic) order of loaded DICOM series whether these IDs were added or not. Now these two attributes are added to RT objects as well.

OK. This is more a cosmetic change, and in fact I should have removed those two attributes from the Slicer core implementation, because they are not really attributes but rather tags. Anyway these shouldn't influence your work, as even if you use SH, UID should be used instead of attribute.

#### 2016-04-07, 14:58:56 - Csaba Pinter
@gregsharp I've exported RT studies with the latest revision, and what I found is that the PatientName, PatientID tags, and the StudyID attribute (maybe more, but haven't tested those) are not used any more. Also the Series number and description tags only work for the anatomical image, but not the dose and RTSS.
It's especially important to restore the usage of the patient and study tags, as anything I export is added into the same patient/study as what I loaded, and is very hard to see what's old and what's new.

The metadata seems to be passed alright to the writer. Maybe I should create a new Study node so that the DICOM importer doesn't automatically put it in the same study (inder the same patient)? I'll keep trying.

#### 2016-04-07, 16:52:39 - Csaba Pinter
Yes, if I create a new Study, then it appears under the new patient too. This might be how the DICOM browser behaves, so probably there is nothing to do with the exporter.
However I should improve the export feature to be more straightforward eventually.

## #669 RT export plugin overwrites existing exported files
DICOM-RT export uses simple file names (dose.dcm, rtss.dcm, imageNNN.dcm) which often overwrites files with the same name in the same folder.

Unique file names should be generated (either globally, generated from the instance UID; or some prefix should be added to the default filenames if a filename exists already).

## #670 Update SRO import/export to work with the new export mechanism
See DicomRtImportExport module changes.

(It's in the branch
https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/slicerrt/branches/DICOMExport/
and not integrated yet, but will be in a few weeks, so either work in that branch or wait until it's integrated)

#### 2014-12-02, 22:39:48 - Csaba Pinter
@wangk
The DICOM export branches have been integrated. You can see that the modules DicomRtImport and DicomRtExport have been merged to one called DicomRtImportExport, and the two logic classes were also merged quite simply. Can you please do the same for SRO imort/export too? Thanks!

#### 2014-12-11, 19:49:21 - Csaba Pinter
Implementation in two phases
1A. Select one study that contains the transform and two volumes. The SRO export plugin identifies the moving image because its parent is the transform, and the other volume will be the fixed image. Problem: a temporary study needs to be created just for export
1B. Select only the transform. The SRO plugin identifies the moving image because its parent is the transform, and pops up a dialog with a short message and single combobox to select the fixed image.
2. Multi-select nodes by checkboxes (or multi-select): Select the transform and two volumes. The SRO plugin does the same as in 1A, but the tree doesn't have to be reorganized. Problem: Checkboxes and multi-selection is not implemented.
I suggest doing 1A or 1B first (1B is probably better), then once I implemented the multi-selection or the checkboxes, go with option 2.

Export volumes from SRO plugin:
As one plugin needs to export all the objects that reference each other (so that the UIDs can be connected), the SRO plugin has to claim the volume nodes too for export, with a reasonable confidence (so that the SRO plugin has the higher combined confidence with a transform and two volumes, but ScalarVolume has higher confidence when choosing volumes only). So the SRO plugin has to export these volumes in one way or the other
1. Call ScalarVolumePlugin::export() Any DICOM plugin can be accessed from python by its name, which is known. Problem: Need to know the series instance UIDs of the expored volumes (read the file back maybe? Not quite elegant).
2. Call the Plastimatch exporter just as the RT plugin does.

I think the current dicom export plugin mechanism needs a bit improvement. this dicom plugin framework works fine for import but not for export as during export all the UIDs have to be created using different plugins and exchanged to other plugins for reference. 

I propose to have a more feature-rich dicom export module, in which the patient, study and series dicom modules can be created and all the UIDs are stored centrally. on the other side, we will have much leaner export plugin which takes the patient, study and series meta data generated by dicom export module and write out the specific dicom files. 

I think it would be good to discuss this with @gregsharp and @pieper.

Fixed in Slicer revision 23810 (DICOM export integration). The series node name is not constructed again in the DICOM plugin, but the name that was assembled at the time of loadable creation is used, so the missing (or doubled) series number issue is solved.

Correspondence with Jim Miller about this (quite a while ago):

' 
It just came to my attention a week ago that Slicer3’s behavior of modifying the transform hierarchy after a registration CLI was executed was never ported to Slicer4.
 
Unfortunately, the mechanism we used in Slicer3 to rewire the scene is not available in Slicer4.
 
But I was able to leverage infrastructure Julian recently submitted which provides a mechanism for VTK events in the processing thread to be diverted to the gui thread.  Using this, I created a mechanism for a “one shot” event to be triggered in the processing thread but handled in the gui thread. The one shot mechanism passes a function object (callback) as the calldata to a generic one shot handler.
 
Jiggering the code a little bit, I think we have a platform on which we can support a wider range of scene edits at the conclusion of a CLI.
 
For example, if our modules used XML like
 
<image reference=”inputVolume”>
    <name>outputVolume</name>
</image>
 
Then we could automatically place the outputVolume in the same hierarchies as the inputVolume.
 
On the implementation side, we need to construct a function object (Command) whose Execute() method implemented the rewiring of the scene, similar to how the vtkSlicerCLIEditTransformHierarchyCallback rewires the transform hierarchy in vtkSlicerCLIModuleLogic.cxx.
 
Then another case needs to be added around line 2249 of vtkSlicerCLIModuleLogic.cxx to trigger the event.

@lassoan Do you think this is something that we should do after or in course of this project? http://wiki.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Labs/CLIInfrastructureCleanupAndRefactoring
I could do something similar to this http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/Slicer4?view=revision&revision=23976, but not sure whether it would become obsolete not long after implementation.

#### 2015-11-07, 01:41:42 - Andras Lasso
Since Subject Hierarchy is in the Slicer core, If there is no specific Slicerrt feature that requires this feature then this ticket can be closed or moved to the Slicer bugtracker.

About implementation: We don't need miniscenes for this (unless we want to create custom Subject Hierarchy node hierarchy), that would be way too complicated. The mechanism would be more similar to how reference attribute is used for transforms. If a reference is specified then the output image is placed into the same place in the transform hierarchy where the referenced image is. Probably it would be better to add a new attribute (subjectReference, subjectHierarchyReference) that would indicate that the output node has to be moved to the same branch in the subject hierarchy where the referenced node is.

According to the latest discussions, the volume is not properly loaded, not the structure set. It is needed to fix the scalar volume import plugin, so that in case of a non-identity geometry, the geometry information is converted into a transformation matrix, which is applied to the loaded volume in the scalar volume plugin in the form of a parent transform. Or maybe just an IJK to RAS matrix, it needs to be decided, but I think IJK2RAS would be a better choice as this information is specific to the volume and should not be stored in two different objects that moreover can be detached from each other.

At the Slicer hangout we agreed that Kevin finds out how to assemble such a matrix from the DICOM tags of the volume, and I will apply it in the scalar volume DICOM import plugin.

No, it should turn to a contour node. It works well on my computer. Did you update both Slicer and SlicerRT? I fixed it yesterday

It turns into a contour node :) This is a feature we've had since the old Patient Hierarchy times.

#### 2014-12-04, 22:17:11 - Csaba Pinter
You can get back the labelmap from it any time by right-clicking and choosing Extract labelmap representation (or similar)

#### 2014-12-04, 22:30:02 - Greg Sharp
But why doesn't it stay in labelmap representation and stay visible?  This seems a bug to me.

Anyway, I agree the original problem is resolved.  Thanks for fixing!

It's still a labelmap essentially, but in a contour node. This is how it has always been. We can discuss this if you want.
Thanks for testing!

Csaba, to clarify, the datasets that cannot be shared are not from QIICR. These are segmentations that are being prepared by participants in a QIN phantom segmentation challenge. Indeed, at the moment at least, the access to these datasets is restricted to QIN. We can discuss with Christian at SLC (he will be there) making one dataset publicly available. I really do not see any problem whatsoever in doing this. I am happy to approach the site that produced that dataset directly, I know most of those people.

#### 2014-12-12, 23:22:46 - Csaba Pinter
The issue is that the contours are not stored in order of the planes, and the algorithm does not reorder them. Need to reorder planes before computing distance between adjacent ones.

The same idea was considered and rejected when implementing the dose engine plugins for EBP. The reasons:
* It would be really complex to maintain two parallel tracks of plugins for the same engines - both of them would need to be registered but from different plugin handlers for each track, connected by qvtk events, etc.
* With the python tests, Qt-based code can be tested nearly as efficiently as VTK (especially with the main window turned off)
* Using qvtk features the same event handling can be performed as in VTK

OK so what I understand you want:
* 3 plots in the chart view if all the above volumes are present
* No line profiles are ever needed for other volumes
* Export the currently shown plot to CSV

Also what line resolution would you like as default? (There is a slider in the tool that lets you set how dense the sampling and so the plot and exported data points will be)

#### 2014-12-16, 21:06:34 - Kevin Alexander
Correct.  So the three volumes are:

-  Planned Dose
-  Optical Gel Dose (after calibration of course)
-  Gamma

Obviously, if Gamma is not calculated, it would not show on the plot.  Gamma values wouldn't appear very well on a plot of dose values anyways.    If there is an easy way to activate/deactivate which profiles are shown/exported, that might be handy.

Line resolution:  Start at 0.5 mm, which I believe is the raw resolution of the optical data?

Thanks.

#### 2014-12-18, 19:08:00 - Csaba Pinter
Thanks for the update!

You say that it's the y scaling that's way off? We'll probably need to adjust the fitting parameters. I cannot do it without your data, but it's just playing with the numbers and setting some initialization based on personal hunch.
What probably needs to be changed is line 275 and/or 276 in GelDosimetryAnalysisLogic.py (yScale parameter values). The initial value should be OK, as it's dynamically computed from the maximums. I think it's the scale that's too low (line 276).

Can you give it a try? Thanks!

#### 2014-12-18, 19:09:55 - Kevin Alexander
Sorry, I should have been more clear.  I mean the visual representation in the three quadrants is solid grey.  The automatic image scaling is off.  You can't see any optical information.

The first warning related to SlicerMacroGetCompilerName is addressed by r23900 [1]

On the other hand, the warning related to policy CMP0038 is explained by the fact the variable MODULE_TARGET_LIBRARIES list qSlicer${MODULE_NAME}Module. After removing this extra line, the setting of the policy CMP0022 at the top could probably be removed.

## #694 Use CMake ExternalData command to download data for automatic logic tests
This is a relatively new CMake feature that would be nice to use. This will reduce source code size and simplify repository.

#### 2015-04-23, 15:32:29 - Csaba Pinter
Using ExternalData for many files has a big overhead (re-generate MD5 sums and update in CMake files), so for DICOM data it would make sense to try to upload them as zip files and then extract it from the test program. Downloading big files may not be reliable on some internet connections, so caution must be used.

Need to set referenced series UIDs centrally in DICOMWidgets::loadCheckedLoadables

#### 2015-01-19, 04:47:52 - Andrey Fedorov
Csaba, I am thinking it may be better to set referenced UIDs by the plugin. Instances referenced may correspond to multiple loadables, or perhaps only some instances would be parsed by the plugin, so setting centrally may not be reliable. What do you think?

#### 2015-01-19, 14:49:12 - Csaba Pinter
Can you give examples? I'm not sure I completely understand.

Also you say instances? The nodes correspond to series. How do we reference instances?

#### 2015-01-19, 22:00:23 - Andrey Fedorov
I see your point better now. You want to reference series instance UID, not UIDs of individual DICOM instances (one series can comprise of multiple DICOM instance).

I was thinking in terms of referencing instance UIDs, similar to what is currently done in Slicer - there is an attribute DICOOM.instanceUIDs that lists all instances that correspond to the individual slices of the volume.

The way references work in DICOM, they do not need to reference the whole series, as I understand. You can have a subset of instances from a series referenced from another DICOM instance. So what I am actually thinking now is that perhaps we should not list the referenced series UID, neither instance UIDs, but should instead maintain a list of Slicer MRML nodes that are referenced by a given node (not sure if this is better to be done at source or destination of reference). This way the reference is direct, and we can always get to the DICOM side of it, since individual MRML nodes should have DICOM.instanceUIDs populated by the plugin at the load time.

If we list all referenced instances (or all referenced series instance UIDs) at the time loadable is loaded, it may be meaningless and we may need to do additional parsing. Example: I have a segmentation object or RT structure set that references a subset of slices from a series, and those slices are not in the local database. Listing any of those UIDs in the MRML node attributes will not be of any use. But if we defer to the plugin, they will be referenced only if a loadable is successfully created.

Sorry if this is not clear, let me know if you would like to chat sometime, and I can try to explain better.

#### 2015-01-19, 22:01:31 - Andrey Fedorov
As aside, it's weird and confusing that I do not automatically follow a ticket I commented on ....

#### 2015-01-19, 22:12:58 - Csaba Pinter
As I see now we have these options for referencing objects from a MRML node that represents a DICOM series we just loaded:
1. MRML attributes containing Series UIDs
  + Uniquely identifies the referenced series, MRML nodes loaded from DICOM have their series UID stored so easy to find, Supports loading separately
  - Cannot reference subsets of series (i.e. set of instances)
2. MRML attributes containing a list of instance UIDs
  + Can reference subsets of series (i.e. set of instances)
  - We'll have to deal with referencing series separately (some objects only reference series, not instances), Need to find series (in order to find MRML node) based on these instance UIDs
3. Use MRML references
  + Can referenre anything that is stored in a node (can be whole series or a subset of it)
  - Only works if we load the referencing and referenced objects the same time

I still vote for 1, unless there is a really good reson to be able to reference a set of instances instead of a whole series.

@pieper What do you think?

#### 2015-01-28, 20:26:05 - Andrey Fedorov
Was checking if there are any updates on this issue. 

I see your point Csaba about 3- and I agree with you. However, to your point 2-, we will have to deal with this one way or another, since scalar volumes reference instance UIDs, not series. And we really need those references, since we need to establish connection between image slice and instance. Perhaps we should consistently do both 1 and 2 from your list above?

I also agree it would be great if @pieper could chime in here. 

#### 2015-01-28, 20:30:09 - Csaba Pinter
Andriy,

Yes, thinking about it again it definitely makes sense to keep the instance UIDs. Not sure how to reference to them though. Maybe keep another UID type (SH has a map for UIDs) and check both when looking for references.

I was also checking on progress and I'm wondering when do you plan to integrate your branch to Slicer? I'd add the derivedItems list to the C++ loadables after the python one is in.

#### 2015-01-28, 20:35:44 - Andrey Fedorov
Right now, ScalarVolume plugin populates DICOM.instanceUIDs attribute in vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode. This is where Steve decided to put it. 

I was waiting to hear from Steve first, that's why didn't do anything about integrating it. I guess I could create a pull request to integrate what I have, and we can update the references part whenever we make the decision what is the right way to do it?



#### 2015-01-28, 20:38:33 - Csaba Pinter
Sounds good to me!
Storing the inctance UIDs in the volume node is fine for now, but I'm thinking about storing both in SH for consistency and to avoid confusion. Svalar volume DICOM import sets up SH anyway so it should be no problem. We can also keep it both places to be backwards compatible.

#### 2015-01-29, 15:30:56 - Csaba Pinter
@fedorov Thanks for integrating! I see that the loadables have a referencedInstanceUIDs, but apparently no referencedSeriesInstanceUIDs. Not all DICOM objects reference instances, sometimes they reference series (as I sort of implied above). If we want to make it clear what to look for when resolving the reference, then we need referencedSeriesInstanceUIDs.
What do you think?

#### 2015-01-29, 22:20:35 - Andrey Fedorov
Sorry, I thought we were talking about MRML node attributes, not loadable attributes.

Sure, but this would be initialized at the DICOM plugin level, not in the DICOMWidgets, right? I can add that in the SEG plugin. But then we yet have to agree once it is initialized on the plugin, where it should go in the MRML node, no?

I talked with Steve today about this, and he mentioned he sent an email with his point of view on this, but I do not see that email! I asked him to comment on this ticket thread. Very confusing. I think we should just get together to discuss this on the next SlicerRT hangout, what do you think?

#### 2015-01-29, 22:40:59 - Csaba Pinter
Yes we were, it was just a related question, but we need to support them on both levels. I think it will need to be supported in the DICOMWidget too so that we populate the referenced list based on both. If your SegObj plugin references instances, then there's nothing to do in that plugin. But I'll need the referenced series list, because in RT there are references to series, but no references to instances, so it has to be handled in some way.

Alright, let's talk about this at the hangout, I'll invite you and Steve in case he can show up.

#### 2015-01-30, 01:27:03 - pieper
(Hi - I responded to the email from assembla but it was dropped.  I think it didn't like that the email had been forwarded but it didn't bounce.  Anyway here's the text).

Hi Csaba, Andrey - 

Can we have a hangout to step through these issues?  I suspect that to really do this correctly we need to have a kind of graph data structure that allows us to make sense of the relationships (like a provenance graph).  I think we should try to diagram this by hand for a few of the key use cases.

I suspect in many cases we want to be able to present the user with information in both directions of the references: backward, as in 'show the two volumes that were registered to create this SRO' and forward as in 'show me all segmentations of this volume'.  Luckily I think for typical slicer work these graphs are not very big so the are fairly lightweight to construct and traverse.

#### 2015-01-30, 01:35:07 - Csaba Pinter
Hi Steve,
Going both directions may be quite slow, but yes. let's talk about it.
I'm free tomorrow after 2PM, Monday morning, or at the Slicer hangout. Andrey cannot make it to the SlicerRT one, so that's out.

#### 2015-01-30, 14:59:12 - Andrey Fedorov
Today after 2pm should be fine for me too.

I created an event and invited you guys.

@gregsharp You got an invitation too incase you'd like to (and can) participate in this discussion about DICOM reference handling in Slicer.

#### 2015-01-30, 23:09:12 - Csaba Pinter
My meeting minutes:

* Consensus: Instance UIDs always present, we should not rely on the Series UID (= ignore it)
** Steve: In some cases we don't have the whole series, only a list of instances
* Possible ways of keeping references:
** Naming convention: '-label' (Steve)
** MRML node references
*** Problem with the above ones if that if you don't load them then you load the connection, whereas if you use the UID itself then it's persistent (Csaba)
** Create DICOM UIDs (hash) for every new object, in its own subclass (Steve) ('DICOM'ifying MRML', will be the way in the longer term)
** Custom DB or any kind of table containing the references (UID to UID(s))
** Dummy SH nodes for unloaded referenced objects (old way of RT import)
* Andriy use case: Reporting, add associated MRML ID in the MRML node (MRML to MRML references, see above * Csaba)
* Steve: Best would be just to use the DICOM DB (involves reading files from disk * Csaba)
** If we just have an MRB then we cannot use the DICOM DB, but we'd like to support references; This could be a known limitation
* Use TagCache to get the references?
* Potential implementations
** Reach back to the DB to check for references (unexplored)
** Store the referenced instance UIDs found in loadables and use those in SH for highlighting and on-demand loading *
* Decision: Due to the fact that we are still stuck with MRML and we need to support certain use cases, we'll implement the most pain-free and guaranteed solution (*)
** In longer term it will be great if we don't have this barrier between DICOM and MRML, database and files and memory

## #698 Change project icon to use OCAIRO logo instead of Sparkit logo
this should apply to all projects not just SlicerRT core.

#### 2015-01-21, 18:47:12 - Andras Lasso
Adding logos should be no problem in general (if there is space), but why would we remove SparKit?
As far as I remember OCAIRO makes maybe 0.5 person contributon to, while SparKit funds 2.5 persons.

#### 2015-01-21, 18:52:08 - wangk
@lassoan, you are correct that SparKit has more funding. however, I got the impression from you guys that you do not want to promote Sparkit in the media. Last time we talked about this and it is concluded that we should promote SlicerRT in all communicatioins. so if there is no need to promote SparKit, then I suggest we can use this space to promote OCAIRO. you can still mention SparKit in the extension acknowledge page. what do you think?

#### 2015-01-21, 18:54:17 - wangk
also I think we should have a unified acknowledge paragraph so it is applied to all the projects we work on. right now the acknowledge statements varies from file to file.

#### 2015-01-21, 19:01:25 - Csaba Pinter
I miss the point of promoting funding sources in the media. Why would we want to do that? We want to promote our product, and we are obligated to acknowledge some of the funding sources. If it was up to me, I wouldn't even have sparkit in the logos, but the teams who created the products (like PerkLab, UHN, whatever).

#### 2015-01-21, 19:10:31 - wangk
Fair enough. I like the idea of putting team instead of funding in logo. so another option is to put Techna logo there instead of OCAIRO. you can get the logo from www.technainstitue.com. UHN is too general and I think we want to be specific so techna would be better. again, it is up to you, if you like to keep the sparkit, that is ok too.

#### 2015-01-22, 19:38:54 - Andras Lasso
We should be as inclusive as possible and acknowledge any support we get. The only constraint might be space - if there is not enough then we may need to be selective. But on the website, documentations, etc. it should be no problem to display any logo.

#### 2015-01-26, 20:51:59 - wangk
@lassoan, 

Yes, I agree. but since we only have this much real estate, so I think we should just include the organizations here (Perklab and Techna in this case to be consistent) the acknowledge section in the module can be used to give credits to the grants.

## #703 Rename SlicerRT extension to 'SlicerRT core'
At least in the extension manager description and the wiki pages. I think the logo is OK.

#### 2015-02-12, 15:26:33 - Csaba Pinter
@lassoan How do you think I should do this? One or more or none of the following:
- Change logo
- Change official extension name (just set(EXTENSION_NAME SlicerRT) to set(EXTENSION_NAME SlicerRTcore) or similar)
- More maybe? (I don't think changing directory names or anything like that is necessary)

#### 2015-02-16, 18:12:57 - Andras Lasso
I don't see how would this help in anything. It should not be too difficult to understand that the SlicerRT kit consists of the SlicerRT extension (containing core features)and several additional extensions (containing specialized features).

#### 2015-02-16, 18:26:22 - Csaba Pinter
We agreed with Kevin to make this change and the last paper I submitted calls the SlicerRT extension SlicerRT core. We can decide not to change anything, but let's make the decision together.
What I think would make sense is to change the extension name (set(EXTENSION_NAME SlicerRTcore)), but nothing else. I don't insist on doing this either.

#### 2015-02-17, 14:36:47 - wangk
I still think it is not very clear to most of  the users. We should clearly say it either on the website or in the documentation that slicerrt is not just the slicerrt extension, it includes all the extensions we have developed. 

on the other hand I agree that slicerrt core is probably not very good name. let us discuss this at our next weekly meeting.

Thanks,

Kevin

#### 2015-02-17, 14:41:33 - Csaba Pinter
Well, I think that SlicerRT core is sort of the only possible name for the core extension. There are not many alternatives. SlicerRT base? Not very good. Maybe we could stick to SlicerRT, and as you mention, Kevin, we can add this information on the wikis.

#### 2015-02-18, 17:15:56 - pzaffino
I think that it is preferable to not change the name, but it is just my opinion.

#### 2015-02-23, 02:43:05 - Csaba Pinter
The majority votes on not to change the name. Additional information may be added to wiki pages, however the extensions relying on SlicerRT should already mention the dependency.

Explanation:
Maximum step size was too small with the new datasets, because of the larger displacement. Because of the increased max. step size, we needed to decrease the relaxation factor to keep it fast, and increase transform scale to prevent unnecessary rotation.

## #709 Add Doxygen documentation for SlicerRT source code
Using doxygen will create a need for us to better document the C++ code. Plus we can throw in some extra user manual info into the html.

Plan on how to proceed:

first step is to manually generate the html and push to a website somewhere and have it link to Assembla. need to ask Andras about where to host it.

Next step to automatically generate the html.

at last is to add other user manual stuff to doxygen.

## #710 Use latest gamma algorithm from plastimatch
New gamma is committed in Plastimatch.
1. Need to update Plastimatch in SlicerRT and make sure gamma works
2. Support new options in Gel dosimetry slicelet
  a) Add option to use linear interpolation (new default) or nearest neighbor (old default)
  b) Add option to get output text from gamma algorithm after it finishes

Description of the new gamma (KGH comments under each in italics):

*<New options>*

* --interp-search: It tries to find the point with minimum gamma value by using normal vector btw. two candidate points. It takes longer time, but gamma pass rates are markedly improved. Resampling dependency is also markedly reduced by using this option.
         _We like this option.  It would be interesting to try it out and see how fast it really is._

* --analysis-threshold: it was hard=coded previously (0.1) Now, it is adjustable. If not given, 0.1(10%) will be used.
        _This is good.  Allow user to set the threshold._

* --resample-nn: when the comparing image is resmapled wrt. the reference image, nearest neighbor will be used for interpolation. (this was previous algorithm used. w/o this option, linear interpolation will be used.
        _Would it be messy to have some option (i.e. checkbox) that allows the user to select either nearest neighbour or linear interpolation?  This gives the user the choice of interpolation based on the relative resolutions of the measured and reference data sets._

* --local-gamma: local reference dose will be used to calculate dose differnce percent. W/o this option, global-gamma will be used. (given reference dose or maximum dose will be used to define dose difference %)
        _This option is good and should be included as an alternative (however, default should still be GLOBAL).  Reference dose input field should allow user to select either 1)  Maximum dose of the entire reference dose distribution, or 2) User defined dose quantity, 3% of which will be taken as the dose criteria.  The wording of all of this NEEDS to be cleaned up as it previously was a tad confusing!_ 

* --inherent-resample <arg>: Before entering the gamma evaluation, super-sampling can be done using this option. It was found that it will not affect that much if the 'interp-search' option is used.
       _ Assuming this means that coarse measured data is re-sampled to a finer resolution??  So – if the user chooses NOT to use interp-search, then this should allow for an option that interpolates the data to the resolution of the reference distribution._

* --output-text <arg>: text report can be acquired. The report includes used options, voxel counts, gamma histogram, etc.
        _This would be a great feature!  Definitely include:  used options (resolutions of each of the measured and reference distributions, the dose analysis threshold, dose and distance criterias), voxel counts, gamma histogram, relevant pass rates…._

* --compute-full-region: W/o this option, gamma values will not calculated for the dose points below the analysis threshold. In the previous version, the software computed full region by default, which took very long time in 3D gamma calculation.
        _Like it.  This would be a good option to have as a checkbox._

* --output-failmap <arg>: export a failmap (binary) after the gamma evaluation
        _So this exports an additional volume with pass/fail for each voxel?  Could be a nice feature, but not crucial._



*NOTE*: 'How to reproduce the same gamma results as before?'

1) DO NOT USE --interp-search , --local-gamma, --analysis-threshold, --inherent-resample

2) MUST USE --resample-nn and (conditionally, --compute-full-region) (if you are only concerned about gamma pass rate,  --compute-full-region is not needed. Use it only when you want to have the same gamma-map as before.)

## #711 Integrate pencil beam algorithm into external beam planning
1. Make Ricardo's pencil beam dose computation algorithm a plugin of External Beam Planning module
2. Use his experiences to improve EBP module interface
3. Optionally keep the custom python module for wizard-like (slicelet-like) frontend, but keep internals in EBP

#### 2015-02-11, 18:33:10 - rcorredorj
Just for the record, I'd be able to include the mechanism to calculate the pencil beams and the GUI. The particular beamlets' or pencil beams' profile should be precalculated or given by the user for a certain modality (photons or protons), as well as the dose calculation algorithm that will give the weights for each beamlet. All this process is very close to what it is described here in this article:
Xuejun Gu, Dongju Choi, Chunhua Men, Hubert Pan, Amitava Majumdar, Steve B. Jiang. GPU-based ultra fast dose calculation using a finite pencil beam model. Physics in Medicine and Biology. 2009



## #712 Add UseEpsilonValuesUnderAnalysisThreshold to Plastimatch gamma
A problem with using analytics threshold for gamma is that the values below that are set to zero, which, when showing it in Slicer in such a way that the background is transparent makes the values under the threshold also transparent. A possible solution is to use Epsilon (=very small value) insead of 0 for values under analysis threshold.

This could be implemented in Plastimatch gamma as a flag in the algorithm called UseEpsilonValuesUnderAnalysisThreshold  or similar.

When performing the gamma using a threshold dose value (i.e. 40% of maximum dose in the plandose), the resulting gamma distribution has black holes where gamma wasn't calculated.  It would be nice to have it set to 0 (i.e. green) even though the gamma technically wasn't computed in those voxels (where the dose is less than the threshold).  Make sense?  I can generate some screengrabs tomorrow if that would help.

Fixed #713: Turned off default normals for ribbon creation, so that the ribbons are generated with the proper orientation. What is very strange is that the normal that is provided by the reader is the same that is computed by the ribbon filter internally, still, the result is different! May it be because the Slicer one is in this form (x,y,z) and the internal ribbon one is (-x,-y,z)? It worked well before, I wonder if this regression is due to the VTK6 upgrade.

Fixed #717: Fixed automatic tests; Default color nodes made singleton so that they are not removed on scene close.

Tests:
- DicomRtImportSelfTest: Failed because of the auto subject hierarchy node creation, the RT image SH nodes were only created when launching Slicer application that had that option set (this is why it passed in that case), the test never created them
- vtkSlicerContoursModuleLogicTest_EclipseProstate: Converted labelmap is shifted in the IS direction by half voxel (it should not be, but it has been like this for a while), and for some reason the ribbon to labelmap conversion flips rasterizing into one adjacent (random) side to the other, so there is a full voxel shift in the output labelmap.

## #720 Python wrapping problem with vtkSegmentation
vtkSegmentation is recognized as just a vtkObject in python interactor.

Attempts to fix and workaround applied in
https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/commit/2189
* Changed const std::string& arguments to simple std::string (change back if turns out that it has no effect, but it seems working better this way)
* Temporary helper class vtkSegmentationPythonWrapHelper to facilitate python usage of vtkSegmentation when wrapping is incorrect

#### 2015-03-25, 20:33:50 - Csaba Pinter
If I created clones of vtkSegmentation  than the first time it had the same issues (with name vtkSegmentationn), but it was OK the second time (vtkSegmentationWrapTest)

## #724 Computed DVH stat  'volume' should account for DoseVolumeOversamplingFactor
In vtkSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleLogic [1], since by default the oversampling factor is 2.0. The computed volume stats (cc) should be divided by DoseVolumeOversamplingFactor^3 to account for the fact the input contour is resampled.

This can be verified by having a structure of exactly 1 pixel for a volume of spacing != 1

Similarly, I also wonder if the computation of the histogram should account for this.

[1] https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/nodes/2046/trunk/SlicerRt/src/DoseVolumeHistogram/Logic/vtkSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleLogic.cxx


#### 2015-04-10, 11:19:29 - Csaba Pinter
The actual volume of the structure does not change due to the fact that it happens to be rasterized with denser grid (more voxels of smaller size fall into it). The structure should always have the same volume regardless the rasterizing grid (or thus the oversampling factor). The small deviations that we see in the volume and the histogram are due to the data loss during rasterization.

Did I misunderstand your question?

#### 2015-04-10, 16:04:27 - jchris
Say differently, the variable <code>cubicMMPerVoxel</code> should probably be computed with the spacing of the resampled label map, otherwise the voxel count  (and by extension the volume) will be off by a factor <code>DoseVolumeOversamplingFactor^3</code>

It means that line 515 [1] could probably be changed from:

<code>
double* structureLabelmapSpacing = structureContourNode->GetSpacing();
</code>

to 

<code>
double* structureLabelmapSpacing = consolidatedStructureContourNode->GetSpacing();
</code>

[1] https://www.assembla.com/code/slicerrt/subversion/nodes/2046/trunk/SlicerRt/src/DoseVolumeHistogram/Logic/vtkSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleLogic.cxx#ln515

#### 2015-04-10, 17:55:37 - Csaba Pinter
Indeed, the line you cite is wrong, it should be the consolidated structure.
I did some debugging and it seems that for some reason the labelmap is invalidated before doing the consolidation step in the DVH computation, and so the labelmap in structureContourNode is re-converted, which causes the consolidatedStructureContourNode spacing to match the original one.
This ultimately results in correct volume computation, this is why we did not catch this problem (there are about 10 DVH logic tests).

We decided to redesign the whole contours infrastructure because the applications considerably overgrew the design, as this bug (and dozens of previously fixed complex bugs) proves it. The contours mechanism became so complicated and so many workarounds have been implemented, that fixing this bug would take me several days probably. As I am making good progress with the new segmentations, and will have to rework all these modules that use contours anyways, I propose putting off fixing this and rely on the new, much simpler infrastructure that will be ready in a few weeks now.
I would keep this ticket open and double check this issue when releasing segmentations.

What do you say?
Thanks for catching this issue!

Make sense to wait. 

To provide some more context, this bug have been discovered by using label map of exactly one pixel and computing the associated stats. It turn out that the volume was off by a factor 8.

Since we are using the logic and object directly, I guess setting the DoseVolumeOversamplingFactor to 1 would provide us with the expected results.

#### 2015-04-10, 18:41:47 - Csaba Pinter
It seems to be a reasonable workaround in your case, yes.

I tried just fixing the line you mentioned, but then it caused an issue in the logic test that checks the metrics, and as I mentioned every hour spent on fixing this will just delay the release of the new one, which requires update of the module logics that use contours/segmentations.

Sorry for the difficulties and thanks again for reporting!

It looks great, but the automated registration of PlanCT to OBI is still not bang on.  Could we add some simple manual shifting options for step 2A?  Just sliders or spinboxes to than allow for a shift in the 3 directions.

PlanCT to OBI intensity registration is not automatically registering very well.  Options to manually tweak registration in 3D using sliders or spinboxes would help (in step 2A of gel extension).

## #731 DICOM export crash
There is a crash in DICOM export, at the following line:
https://github.com/cpinter/Slicer/blob/master/Modules/Scripted/DICOMLib/Widgets/qSlicerDICOMExportDialog.cxx#L263
Also if there is no crash (sometimes it happens), the exportables are the same in the list (i.e. the same series is displayed 3 times instead of showing the 3 series in the study).

The issue is most probably that the exportable objects get deconstructed during passing from python to C++. I downloaded a nightly just before this commit
https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/9b7171d097ad0cfa1fe89780a2ef0758cf2ae80e
and indeed, the crash is not there, the exportables are showing up correctly.

Good catch! Do we only use it to show the structure name of the DVH? Then your fix is perfect, go ahead please.

However if we also want to use it to reference the segment, then segment ID is the right way, in which case we should rename the attribute and the fix should go to where the structure name is displayed (get segment name from segment found by the referenced ID). Looking at the code, I think it's just for the name currently. I'll leave it up to you to judge.

Thanks!

#### 2015-06-22, 14:10:59 - Csaba Pinter
Also please use the milestone for the tickets, at least before closing so that the closed tickets are indicated at the right milestone. Right now it is an exceptional state because we have two active SlicerRT milestones (we didn't know when segmentations would be released and it made sense to keep that one separate), but usually any bugfixes should go into the current SlicerRT milestone,, which is right now 0.18.

thanks for the note. Moving forward, I will make sure to associate a milestone

'Grepping' the code, I found it used directly only in qSlicerDoseVolumeHistogramModuleWidget and indirectly to display the plot name in Jquery

Moving forward, if needed we could introduce 'DVH_STRUCTURE_ID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME'

I will go ahead and commit the change

Re #743: Removed vtkMRMLExternalBeamPlanningNode and made the vtkMRMLRTPlanNode the 'parameter set' node. The reason is that the EBP node had only one input reference (the plan node itself), and also because in case of modules that basically handle a type of node (Volumes, Models, Segmentations, etc.) have that type of node as the main node to select, without a separate parameter set node.

Re #743: Improved dose visualization. Dose color table is created from the isodose color table in the Isodose module (not DicomRtImportExport), and no node IDs are stored, but the node is got by name (it is a singleton, and there is no need to have two mechanisms of accessing the node, also it's bad practice to store node IDs in logic classes). After dose calculation the dose color table is set the same way as when importing a dose volume; Improved dose visualization after dose computation by setting the volume opacity to 0.5 (it was 0 most of the time so the volume did not show up); Code clean up, stylistic changes and removal of unnecessary variables.

Re #743: Move target and isocenter specification from beams to plan: there was an inconsistency between these, as iso.spec. and target were beam parameters, but they could change isocenter, which was a plan parameter. To make it more consistent and robust, these parameters are in the same level (plan). Later, when multiple targets and isocenters will need to be allowed for a plan, the feature will be introduced with the concept of beam groups. For now multiple plans need to be created in such a case and manually accumulate the doses after calculating for each plan; Isocenter specification on the UI became a combobox with label 'isocenter at target center', as basically this is the purpose of isocenter specification, however the enumeration in the class member was left as before; EBP UI was rearranged so that all parameters fit in a reasonable space

Re #743: Updated External Beam Planning to use Qt-based dose engine plugins instead of VTK-based ones WIP.

This enables adding custom UI for the special beam types, and Python wrapping, which is essential for Matlab-based and Python dose engines and useful for command-line ones. vtkSlicerExternalBeamPlanningModuleLogicTest1 is disabled for now, it will be needed to convert to a Python test. Also the existing dose engines do not work as yet, because the special beam types are not handled with the new plugin mechanism. Thus the module is unfunctional for the moment, but it is experimental, and also fix will arrive in a few days.

## #748 Playing in Sequence Browser undoes transform hierarchy
I noticed that the transform hierarchy is 'undone' when using the Sequence Browser module with the following steps:

1. Drop previously computed ImageToProbe transform into Slicer.
2. Drop previously recorded tracked ultrasound imaging sequence into Slicer as a sequence metafile.
3. Create the following transform hierarchy: 
   TrackedUltrasoundSequence-ProbeToReference [time=###s]
    - ImageToProbe
      -- TrackedUltrasoundSequence-Image [time=###s]
4. Open Sequence Browser module (Active browser node: TrackedUltrasoundSequence, Master node: TrackedUltrasoundSequence-Image, all nodes synchronized).
5. Play the sequence.

When I play the sequence from the Sequence Browser module, the TrackedUltrasoundSequence-Image [time=###s] node is immediately moved out from under the ImageToProbe transform. That is, the transform hierarchy becomes:
  TrackedUltrasoundSequence-Image [time=###s]
  TrackedUltrasoundSequence-ProbeToReference [time=###s]
    - ImageToProbe

This occurs with the latest Slicer nightlies, but not with the 2015-05-12 version.

Based on our conversation:
* Speed is improved, the algorithm is now slightly faster than the planar->ribbon->labelmap->surface path. Still would be nice to further improve speed, as in the past the user did not have to wait for the whole path, only for the planar->ribbon conversion, so loading was done faster. Please spend a bit more time profiling and trying to see if there is room for making it faster.
* In terms of the 'long concentric tubes' scenario, which takes about 20-30 times more time than if it was a regular dataset. It is probably not possible to detect it quickly before conversion (at an assessment phase), but it might be detected while converting (like detecting that the certain control branch in the code is hit way more times than it should), the algorithm could fire an event with a message that the UI displays to the user so that they don't think the application hang.

As the algorithm is fast enough not to be disruptive, I decrease the priority of the ticket to low.
Also since the algorithm is quite complex, especially with handling the special cases, it is not realistic to expect huge performance improvement.

## #751 Contours to surface does not account for the top slice thickness
When rasterizing a surface that was created using contours to surface, the top slice seems to be 'cut off' compared to when doing the same via ribbons, see attachments.

The reason for this is that the first and last slice also have thickness, but the algorithm simply closes the surface using Delaunay triangulation, thus ignoring some of the volume that was originally included. Instead, a single point should be added one slice above the top slice, in the position of the center of gravity of the contour (one point for each branch), and similarly to the bottom slice. Doing this as a preprocessing step and doing the triangulation of this structure, then omitting the Delaunay step should fix this issue.

Re #751: Attempt to account for slice thickness in planar contour to closed surface conversion by extending external contours by a half-slice thickness.

Suggested approach:
1. Copy top/bottom contour (as currently)
2. Convert that one contour to binary labelmap with the reference volume geometry (or supersampled)
3. Erode until half the area remains. Either a) Calculate distance map and find threshold that gives half the original area (see if vtkImplicitModeling can be used) or b) Calculate area then erode by one voxel iteratively until half the area remains
4. Convert labelmap to contour and add to structure

Please send me an email with the two lists of these datasets, marking which of these we have in our SVN (SlicerRt/data) and which we don't.

## #753 Show dose volumes only checkbox does not work with segmentations
The attribute filtering in MRML node comboboxes work with only one attribute at a time that can be overwritten by a subsequent addAttribute call. So in the previous implementation with Contours the dose volume attribute was simply overwritten by the labelmap attribute with 0 value. Now that there is no labelmap attribute, this cannot be done, and unfortunately the API does not support removing attributes from filtering.

## #755 Replace optical density with optical attenuation on gel slicelet UI
Optical attenuation with unit cm^-1 is more accurate than the unitless optical density

Awesome, thanks!
Sorry btw for the double brackets issue, it seems to slip through every time. I'm getting used to it myself, but this time it was a student's code that I integrated. Should have paid more attention.


## #757 Create editor module to edit segmentations
The decision is that modifying the Editor module to handle segmentations is too risky (due to the organic codebase and the high chance of regressions on any change), so creating a new editor module for segmentations is necessary.
* Use qMRMLSegmentsTableView for selecting and managing segments (analogous to per-structure box in Editor module)
* Initiate editing from segmentation module (Edit button) and subject hierarchy (Segment action for volumes)
** Subject hierarchy core Segment plugin to create segmentation instead of labelmap, start editing, save geometry to new segmentation #578
* Create labelmap representation and use existing Editor effects to edit it

#### 2015-08-06, 18:17:21 - Csaba Pinter
In the meantime editing segments is possible by exporting segment to labelmap volume node, edit in Editor, then import back to segmentation if needed

re #757: Optimized speed of vtkOrientedImageDataResample::CalculateEffectiveExtent

CalculateEffectiveExtent is still the largest contributor to slow response time at effect application for large volumes.
It might be possible to further optimize the code but most probably the best would be to allow effects to provide what extent they updated. It would be optional and would only be used by paint, draw, erase, etc. effects (that operate in a small region only).

re #757: Multiple extent related fixes.

* Fixed vtkOrientedImageDataResample::TransformExtent by extending making sure the entire voxel fits in the transformed voxel, not just the center.
* Fixed vtkOrientedImageDataResample::PadImageToContainImage to compute the containedImage's extent in the input image extent's frame.
* Fixed appending labelmap by keeping (or expanding) the inputImage extent (earlier it was clipped to the common extent). Also replaced vtkImageMath (a very inefficient filter) by a dedicated function for performing maximum operation in-place.
* Fixed crash in CalculateEffectiveExtentGeneric by adding image data null-pointer check.

Remaining problems:
* Paint effect cannot handle image geometry that differs from the reference image
* Draw and rectangle effects look good in the slice but drawing thickness should be retrieved from the slice's spacing (slice viewer knows it, it may be manually set)

re #757: Reworked segment editor

The edited labelmap is just a modifier image now (containing the last stroke that has to be added/removed/replaced in the existing labelmap). This allows applying the modification to the current segment and its inverse to other segments. This enables a new key feature: masking. Masking can be used to restrict editing to certain regions (inside/outside specific segments) and to control overlap/overpaint.

Also reworked how segment labelmap geometry is determined. Geometry defined in 'reference image geometry' conversion parameter is used as edited segment labelmap geometry. If it's not defined then geometry of existing segments are used. If there were no existing segments either, then the master volume's geometry is used. If master volume is changed, segment labelmap geometry remains the same and so other various volumes can be used as master volumes (they are resampled to match the segment labelmap geometry).

Painting can now be performed on any slice orientations, as a 3D brush is generated. The 3D brush is shown in all other views (both 2D and 3D). 2D brush thickness is determined by slice spacing.

Painting is now possible on 3D views, too.

Editable intensity range is now available for all effects. It controls what area of the image the selected segment is allowed to be changed. It brings 'threshold paint' to other effects, such as rectangle, drawing, etc.

Experimentally, use built-in VTK morphological operators for dilation.

You can already try it in SlicerRT nightly versions (these new changes will be available tomorrow) but it'll take a few more weeks to fix all the bugs and optimize performance. We'll also add new features in the coming few weeks that have become very easy to implement, such drawing on 3D views for removing objects by contouring them in the 3D viewer, logical operators, more morphological operators, etc.

I think a demo will be very useful once Andras is done with the masking/paint-over features. I created Segment Editor to have the exact same functionality as Editor, with the completely new architecture, just to prove that it works. Now Andras is making it stable and easier to use, exploit the advantages of Segmentations over labelmaps, and an overhaul of the masking feature.

We talked a lot about the masking changes, and I think it would be good if at least you guys also agreed on it.

re #757: Automatically create segment display properties for any segment.

Requesting display properties from any segment is always considered a valid request from now on. There is no need for checking output of vtkMRMLSegmentationDisplayNode::GetSegmentDisplayProperties, as it always returns valid properties. This was necessary to allow displaying a segment with default settings without explicitly specifying display settings.

Made segment property reading more robust. Segments can be read if their specification is incomplete (for example, if color is not specified then default color will be used)

These reader/writer classes are used throughout Slicer to read 4D images. Data is stored as list of 3D volumes instead of a 4D spatial volume.

A side effect is that a segmentation can now be loaded as a sequence (useful for testing).

Reader for the old file format is kept for now for backward compatibility (can be disabled by undefining or removing parts marked with #ifdef SUPPORT_4D_SPATIAL_NRRD).

re #757: Several segmentations bugfixes

* Fixed editing of imported segments: imported segments are added to the segmentation as they are, but when they are edited they are resampled using the reference geometry spacing, origin, direction; also, editing is fixed by always extending the edited labelmap, mask, etc. so that all the segments are covered. This extent expansion is not used when generating merged labelmap: the merged labelmap is generated using the exact reference geometry.
* Fixed storage of segments that are outside the extent of reference geometry extent (the extent is expanded to include all segments)
* Fixed oversampling factor application.
* Fixed merging of volumes with different scalar types.
* Optimized merged labelmap computation speed (implemented as a new processing mode in MergeImage method), works on any scalar type.

* Moved segmentation editor binary labelmap master representation check to the time when an effect is activated. Earlier the master representation was verified when the segmentation node was selected but users sometimes change the master representation, so a more frequent check is needed.

* Fixed vtkOrientedImageDataResample::MergeImage extent handling (custom extent can only shrink the common image extent)
* Fixed loading problem of Python editor effects. For some users __file__ returns invalid path (only a single backslash after the user name, e.g., C:\\\\Users\\\\SomeUser\\AppData\\\\...). Converting it to linux-style path by changing backslashes to forward slashes fixed the problem.
* Made Python editor effect loading simpler (they have to be listed in SegmentEditorEffects.__init__.py.in only once and if any of the effects fail to load then detailed error is logged and other effects may still be loaded.
* Changed behavior of segment editor widget so that the modifier labelmap is never automatically reset (it cause unintended side effects in plugins) but only when self.scriptedEffect.defaultModifierLabelmap() is called. The last cached modifier labelmap can be always retrieved using self.scriptedEffect.modifierLabelmap().

## #758 File name issues with double extensions in segmentations storage
* After the first click on save the extension is seg.seg.nrrd
** qSlicerSaveDataDialogPrivate::populateNode re-uses the same QFileInfo instance, and it is being changed during certain function calls. this->createFileFormatsWidget(storableNode, fileInfo)) call (line 465) changes the correct extension and the createFileNameItem call a few lines below gets the corrupted one
* Rando segmentations when saved as volume lose the beginning of their file names
* .seg.nrrd is defaulted to regular volume instead of segmentation (need to select Segmentation instead of Volume to load it as segmentation)

## #759 Memory leak when closing scene after computing DVH


#### 2015-08-06, 19:11:37 - Csaba Pinter
Fixed #759: Memory leak fixed when closing scene after calculating DVH. The leak itself was fixed by replacing vtkMRMLScene::CreateNodeByClass call to ordinary smart pointer new call. Apparently CreateNodeByClass is not safe to use; The lines added to OnMRMLSceneEndClose empty the DVH table after scene is closed (the arrays were still on the UI)

Hi Csaba,

Thanks, Jc!
So it is safe to use then, but it needs to be handled similarly to the functions that return vtkCollections. Good to know!

Re #760: Add function to disable representation. Useful for testing if one wants to use a non-default conversion path without manual UI interaction.

Example usage from python (before loading the dataset):
import vtkSegmentationCore
vtkSegmentationCore.vtkSegmentationConverterFactory.GetInstance().DisableRepresentation('Closed surface')

Now it is used to make sure the labelmaps are created via ribbon model, to verify that the test baselines match exactly with the old contour ones. Later when direct closed surface conversion is proven to be correct, the tests can be changed to use that.

Re #760, re #766: Fix tests that failed due to recent changes regarding transform handling. One error source was that the bounding box transformed function TransformOrientedImageDataBounds did not handle non-zero extent starts. The other one was that in many places vtkGeneralTransform is passed as transform, and it was always handled as non-linear. However, it can also be linear transform if all concatenated transforms are linear. Now this is detected and the linear transform control branches are also hit.

## #761 Generate report for gel dosimetry session

## #762 Segment comparison fails if the reference extent does not entirely contain the compare image
If the reference segment labelmap extent does not contain entirely the compare extent, then the resample_image function in Plastimatch returns an empty resampled compare image (largest possible region all zeros), thus DIce and Hausdorff yield invalid results.

I'll apply a fix for this in SlicerRT, but it may be worth fixing in Plastimatch too.

Simplest way to reproduce:
* Load TinyPatient (can be found in the data folder in the SVN)
* Choose Tumor for reference and Body for compare in Segment Comparison
* Click Compute (Hausdorff and Dice both fail)

Apparently other mismatches also lead to empty compare volumes:
* Load RANDO Prostate dataset
* Expand Bladder by 5mm uniform in Segment Morphology
* Calculate Dice in Segment Comparison with Expanded_5_5_5_Bladder as reference and 3: RTSTRUCT: PROS / Bladder as compare
I did not dig very deep, but it's as though the resample_image function does not handle non-zer largest possible region index (makes it always 0 although it should be non-zero)

#### 2015-08-17, 16:34:02 - Greg Sharp
This bug may still need attention.  The images should be resampled to contain (at least) the union of non-zero voxels in both images.  In some cases, this means resampling both images.

Placing computation results below the source data node in subject hierarchy works quite well, too, instead of just using a generic node reference. The advantage is that the reference is well visible to the users, related data are kept together and if parent node is deleted then children are removed, too.

However, it can also be linear transform if all concatenated transforms are linear. Now this is detected and the linear transform control branches are also hit.

## #768 Use multi-selection for DICOM export
It is now possible to select multiple nodes in subject hierarchy, and it would be good if the user could use that feature to select objects to export to DICOM.
* On multi-selection, all context menu options are disabled except for Delete. It will be needed to implement handling of 'multi-enabled' actions
* The selected series could be in different studies or could be outside any study. How to auto-fill the patient/study fields?


## #769 Improve subject hierarchy transform handling
Issues with the current version:
* Full transform name is not visible, only the first several letters. The field width also does not increase when the module is made wider (due to Qt limitation).
* Having to double-click on the transform field in order to change the parent transform is a lot of interaction.
* Access of transform hardening is inconsistent. In Data module it is in the context menu, on SH it is in the Transforms menu (bottom of the menu after double clicking)

Proposed changes:
* Instead of the transform name, show an icon if the node is transform. There could be different icons for linear and deformable transforms.
* Open the transform menu with a single left-click on the icon. The transform menu would be the same as now. (Note: I think the user might be confused about the right-click context menu and the left-click transforms menu, but we could give a hint in a tooltip that appears for the icon or the empty transform cell)
* Add harden transform in the right-click context menu for nodes that are transformed

Some users need to close Matlab gracefully (without killing the process)

#### 2015-09-30, 01:07:52 - Andras Lasso
test #774: Added a command to stop the Matlab process (if running)

Usage:
Slicer.exe --launch c:\\Users\\lasso\\devel\\MatlabBridgeExtension-win64dbg\\lib\\Slicer-4.4\\cli-modules\\Debug\\MatlabCommander.exe --exit-matlab

Note that Matlab can be also stopped from the Slicer GUI (or any other Slicer module) by sending the 'exit' command through the MatlabCommander module.

re #774: Added a flag to stop the Matlab process after completion (based on Alexis Girault's patch)

If no command is specified then Matlab is not launched, therefore it is safe to run --exitmatlab with an empty command if the goal is to shutdown Matlab.
The difference compared to sending an 'exit' command to Matlab is that if Matlab was not running and an exit command is sent then Matlab is started and then shut down.
Running Matlab Commander with an empty command and --exitmatlab shuts Matlab down if it was running and does not do anything if Matlab was not running.

## #779 LANDWARP should export TPS as native transform
Currently the TPS (thin plate spline) transform is exported as a GridTransform.  It could be instead exported as an ITK TPS, without rasterizing into a grid transform.

#### 2015-11-09, 19:31:54 - Greg Sharp
Information from Andras:

You can pass any transform type if you don't specify the type attribute in the XML.

If you implement your transforms as VTK transforms then we can use them in Slicer (real time apply to any nodes, field visualization, inversion, etc). To be able to use ITK transform reader/writer for new transform types you don't have to implement the transform computation in ITK, just add a transform class derived from a similar transform (and - if you have additional parameters - override the get/set parameters methods). Everything else will work automatically, transform IO classes will read/write all the transform parameters and use your custom class name to identify the ITK object that has to be instantiated. Of course, it's even nicer if you implement computation methods in the ITK class, too.

## #782 Convert to dose volume function silently fails
If the volume the user wants to convert to dose is not under a study, the operation fails with an error message logged. As the error icon is almost always red, and even if not, the user does not notice the change, an error message would help the user identify the problem.

Maybe a more visible effect could be useful on the long run to indicate a new error message. Like a 'flashing' of the error icon or similar.

## #784 Add convenience function to get segment labelmap
Currently there are methods for getting representations, but as the specific ways the labelmaps are processed in the modules (SegmentMorphology/Comparison, DVH, DoseComparison), it is a bit fragmented. It would be nice to
1. Implement a convenience function for each type of labelmap extraction (used in the modules above)
2. In a way that it considers parent transforms and such. Maybe add an option to consider parent transform of an object it will be used with (reference volume, whose transform's inverse will be applied on the extracted labelmap)
Probably the best route would be to return a vtkOrientedImageData and include in the documentation how to use it further (e.g. vtkSlicerSegmentationsModuleLogic::CreateLabelmapVolumeFromOrientedImageData)

The DVH table contains checkboxes for visualization so those need to be supported. Plan:
* Have a delagate that displays vtkBitArray as checkbox and vtkStringArray as simple text (could be further improved to support colors)
* When saving a vtkBitArray to file, the type should be specified as a qualifier after the column name such as 'selected [type=bool]'
** Further improvement later could be specifying display type as well: 'color [type=double|display=color]' (because double arrays can be positions etc. too)
* Observing the vtkBitArray separately is possible to change the display when the user checks a checkbox

## #786 Add support for open contours
Issue reported in http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=4087
Adding this support will be also useful for future projects.

The open contours are to be loaded to segmentation objects with
* Non-planar contour
** Contains the raw contour points
** Converter is needed to closed surface
* Closed surface containing the tube model
** What should be the radius of the tube? Half of the slice thickness calculated from the planar contours from the other contained structures? Constant 1mm? -> Start with 1mm, it will be a conversion parameter

## #787 Create module for deformable registration of two segments
A convenient module is needed for deformable (and rigid) registration of a segment in two structure sets.

The driving application is prostate MRI/US registration (but the module should be kept as general as possible): MRI image and prostate segment and US image and segment is received as DICOM images and structure sets. Based on the registration of prostate, all other structures in the MRI structure set needs to be deformed to the US volume space.
Existing registration module in SlicerProstate should be used/improved as much as possible (to minimize code duplication).

Plan accepted by Andriy Fedorov to consolidate the SlicerProstate voxel-based and SlicerRT segmentations-based approaches:
* CP1. Temporarily copy parts of the computation code from DMBR to SegmentRegistration to decrease the amount of conversions and preprocessing (and have less intermediate nodes afterwards)
* CP2. Move SegmentRegistration to SlicerRT until Segmentations gets integrated into Slicer core (as it depends on Segmentations, and it will go to the core really soon)
* CP3. Make sure the Fedorov paper and all contributions are properly acknowledged throughout the code and wiki pages
* CP4. Integrate Segmentations, SegmentEditor, and SegmentRegistration into Slicer core (we are confident that it is robust and powerful enough to become the new standard for handling structures on the long term - I am aware that many people have doubts, I’ll write a technical note paper soon and try to prove its necessity more formally)
* AF5. Integrate the minimum subset of the DMBR algorithm that fully functional to BRAINS (move SegmentationSmoothing or only its ITK algorithm into BRAINS too?)
* AF6. Update the DMBR SlicerProstate module to use the BRAINS implementation (this yields a very thin module with only the UI for labelmap and volume selection, and visualizing the results)
* CP7. Update SegmentRegistration to use the BRAINS implementation (same kind of thin module with same functionality, but it would instead work with Segmentation nodes)

Additional tasks:
* Allow extraction of strictly rigid transform (currently the two output transformations are the Deformable and an Affine)

With the DWI SH plugins (DTI volume, and plugins for the seeding modules in SlicerDMRI) and the labelmap export option in the segmentations SH plugin, integration is almost complete.
The last piece is CLI support for segmentations, so that the labelmap export step (which is now much more convenient with the SH option) can be eliminated completely.

Closing this issue as fixed, as the CLI work alone will fix it. Also as the Slicer core tickets are going into the Slicer Mantis, there will be no connection between the tickets anymore.

## #800 Add movable separator to Subject hierarchy and Segmentations
The movable separator under the model hierarchy tree in Models module is very useful. It would be nice if the same widget could be used under the SH tree and the SegmentsTable.

It was decided that Subject hierarchy does not need such a separator as the widget is always resized to the tree view, and it is the main part of the module.
As the separator was added to Segmentations, I'm closing the ticket.

Can you please revert the description change? Changing the problem statement goes against the idea of tickets. In the ticket we define the problems, and we shouldn't remove any items, because we won't know what to test when we're done. We can only change ticket descriptions when it becomes invalid, and even then we should document it somewhere what was the original. Please add comments instead. Thanks!

Thanks for fixing the RTImage import! I haven't tested yet, but I will test everything once I'm finally all done with the segment editor (soo close now).
I noticed that the DicomRtImportSelfTest fails. Can you please take a look at it? Most probably due to the different types and number of nodes that are created. Thanks!

## #804 When window/leveling RT image Slicer hangs
After DICOM-RT import, Slicer intermittently exhibits performance issues.  This has been observed on linux, where CPU usage goes to 100% for a few minutes.

One operation that can sometimes reproduce the problem is to load an RT IMAGE, view the image in slice view, and then change window/level with the mouse.

Occasionally the problem occurs simply by loading a DICOM-RT directory, and using ALT-TAB to change between windows.

## #806 Scripted module generic test fails if loadable module dependency is specified
The problem is that the additional module paths don't contain the loadable modules, and in case of SegmentEditor, the Segmentations module is needed (temporarily removed so that it passes until this is solved).
The only reason the DvhComparison generic test passes, is that its dependency list is empty (incorrectly).

## #809 Segmentation PolyData 2D fill visualization not stable
The pipeline that generally worked (was taken from this example http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/FilledPolygon):
1. vtkCutter on the closed surface (generates the lines correctly for 2D outline visualization)
2. vtkStripper (creates loops)
3. Set lines as cells in polydata to display
However, it resulted in incorrect polygons for thresholded results (MRHead -> Threshold in (Segment)Editor -> Generate model -> Show segmentation as filled polydata).
See history of 2D segmentations displayable manager:

## #812 DICOM export cannot handle shear in the parent transform
If the exported anatomical volume has a parent linear transform with shear component, the exported volume is incorrect, as it contains only translation, rotation, and scale information from the transform.

Proposed fix:
Check at time of DICOM export if the volumes have such parent transforms, and do resampling in those cases instead of simply applying the transform.
(vtkSlicerDicomRtImportExportModuleLogic::ExportDicomRTStudy lines 1741 and 1753)

Python code for printing the dot products of the axes (which are 0 for matrices without shear):
x = vtk.vtkVector3d(m.GetElement(0,0), m.GetElement(1,0), m.GetElement(2,0))
y = vtk.vtkVector3d(m.GetElement(0,1), m.GetElement(1,1), m.GetElement(2,1))
z = vtk.vtkVector3d(m.GetElement(0,2), m.GetElement(1,2), m.GetElement(2,2))

You didn't choose 'Yes to all' to enable subject hierarchy. This window (as explained in the text if you have read it) tells the user that SH is not enabled, and if you want to use SH for all the nodes in the scene then something must be done.

You see the nodes because the first half of them are created when you import the DICOM data, and the second half during use of EBP. If you choose 'Yes to all' in this dialog, or enable subject hierarchy in application settings, then this dialog will never pop up again (until you delete Slicer.ini), and SH nodes will be automatically created for the supported data nodes.

The reason why SH is not enabled by default (and so SH nodes for the supported nodes are not created, which is what the logic detected and showed the dialog) is that many people don't use it, and if they deal with for example atlases with a thousand nodes in them, then it slows down Slicer. This may be changed later, but it was a safety 'feature'.


## #814 Labelmap contour interpolation between slices
A feature is needed that
* Interpolates contours between slices (series of 2D labelmaps -> 3D labelmap)
* Linear and higher order interpolation as well
* Arbitrary gap between the slice contours

Possible implementation is a SegmentEditor effect that has one button for performing the interpolation, and works as follows:
* Creates contours from the sparse labelmap slices
* Runs PlanarContourToClosedSurface on the contour set
* Converts surface to labelmap
* Writes labelmap back to segment

## #816 Add local gamma option to dose comparison module
Choi, Gye Won (Diane):
'
On a different note, my committee brought up the fact that since we hope to use Slicer for future projects as well, it would be nice if Slicer could do local Gamma analysis as well. 
This is under the impression that local gamma analysis will be more useful when comparing measurements between two different dosimeters, since we want the measurements using two dosimeters to agree at all dose levels, if possible. 

Is this an option that can be implemented? 
Ideally, I would like the Gamma analysis to be able to do a local gamma analysis while excluding points with dose less than a certain global value.

There is a visibility checkbox in the Display section under the segments table that you can use to show/hide the whole segmentation. Does it satisfy your needs?

Also there are visibility tools in Subject hierarchy, such as per-segment and all-segment show/hide, and also context menu action for hiding all segments except one.

## #823 Segmentation disappears after deselecting volume in slice view

Most probably same problem as http://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=4251

Steps before error:
1. Save segmentation as .nrrd file
2. Close and reopen slicer, reload file as segmentation
3. Load in data via DICOM (CT scan used)
4. Go to segmentation editor

Unable to see structure through the segment (opacity_bug.png)

Thanks, Kyle! I reopened the ticket. Some questions:
1. Loading what segmentation? That you saved after editing? What is the master of the segmentation you load?
2. Creating a new segment in the loaded segmentation? Creating new segmentation with binary labelmap master? Or what?
Also how is showing/hiding anything in the slice view influences the opacity?

1. No, I just loaded TinyPatient from Dicom. Master was contours.
2. Conversion of the planar contour -> closed surface -> binary labelmap pathway
Upon further inspection, it's not that the opacity is necessarily wrong, but the background behind the segmentation always appears to be black.

Thanks! I'll investigate

#### 2016-06-16, 14:07:37 - Csaba Pinter
My findings:
* Opacity values in the segmentation displayable manager are right
* Setting the displayed volume in the slice view to None somehow breaks opacity handling in that particular slice view (if I set it to None in only one, then only in that one slice view will the segmentation obscure the volume completely)

Further issue: opacity values coming from DICOM-RTSS are ignored

#### 2016-06-16, 14:23:44 - Csaba Pinter
Correction: Opacity values set when loading DICOM-RTSS are not actually ignored, but only used in 3D, and the opacities in 2D are the default values (0.4). So the opacity value shown in the segments table and what we see in the 2D views are not in sync. But when the user changes segment opacity, then it is applied to both 2D and 3D. This behaviour is inconsistent.

## #826 Save segmentations into vtm with labelmap master too
Currently vtm (multiblock dataset format) is written for poly data master representations, but a 4D NRRD is written for labelmaps. The problem with 4D nrrd is that it may have huge memory usage especially in case of many segments, because the union of the extents are used.
It would be better in this sense to use vtm file (which is an XML pointing to files in a directory with the same name) for labelmaps too, because the segments can be saved one by one. Other advantages:
* The resulting NRRD files can be loaded as labelmaps individually if needed
* vtm can be the file extension for segmentations in Slicer, and we could get rid of the extension problems too (#758)

Implementation: vtkXMLMultiBlockDataWriter::WriteComposite writes the individual blocks into files, but for images it probably uses vti. It will need to be subclassed to use the NRRD writer. It can be done by also subclassing vtkXMLCompositeDataWriter and reimplement CreateWriters so that it creates NRRD writer instead of vtkXMLImageDataWriter

#### 2016-06-18, 09:41:33 - pieper
We should also consider using DICOM as the native representation since it also supports multiple blocks and might have other advantages as well (cross references, interoperability, etc)

#### 2016-06-18, 14:25:52 - Csaba Pinter
We have two parallel ways of saving/loading, and the Save file dialog traditionally saves non-DICOM data, while DICOM export is the one that saves DICOM. Do you propose to export to DICOM using the Save file dialog too?

Yes, I was thinking that most users wouldn't know what a .vtm file is, so it wouldn't make any difference if it was something like a .seg.dcm file instead, even if they hadn't specifically requested a DICOM export (that is, it's just an opaque storage format anyway, so why not pick the one that has the best representation for the types of data we want to support).  And if we know we want the DICOM export also, then focusing our effort on just one save/restore path would most likely be the more maintainable solution.

#### 2016-06-19, 07:29:47 - Andras Lasso
.vtm is a standard VTK file format. It can be read by any VTK-based application. It's actually an index file that contains links to a list of simple VTK data files (vtp, vti, ...). If an application doesn't support multi-block data sets, those simple VTK data files can be already loaded by many VTK-based applications.

For proper DICOM read-write we need patient information, references to other nodes, a capable DICOM toolkit, etc, which are all available in Slicer's DICOM module but not in MRML. So, I think we'll have both native VTK saving for simplicity and broad compatibility and DICOM saving for DICOM-based workflows.

#### 2016-06-19, 13:39:52 - pieper
I'd still argue that a DICOM file, even a rare one like a SEG or a slightly broken one like a file with empty patient information would be preferable to any of the vtk file formats, particularly for segmentation data since it can encode image orientations and suggested colors for each segment.  MRML depends on VTK and ITK, both of which provide enough DICOM support via (the current) DCMTK.   I'd also like to see us get to the point where missing patient information is handled that the time of import.  For legacy or deidentified data we can create pseudonym patient ID information and use the subject hierarchy to manage groupings (reassigning IDs and references) so that all identified and deidentified data would be handled consistently.

I understand supporting DICOM at this point would involve extra effort so using the .vtm files in the near term may be best.  We should discuss with Andrey to get his thoughts.

#### 2016-06-19, 14:27:12 - Andras Lasso
We already store all necessary metadata in standard VTK file formats in custom metadata, so there is no blocking issue, but of course it's not nice that those are not standardized.

It's not really a question of which formats we will support, as we must support simple research file formats because we simply have no power of dictating researchers that we work with to switch now if they want to use Slicer. They would just simply not use Slicer. We also want to support DICOM, because we like to be compliant to open standards and many features that we need (and we'll need in the future) is already nicely specified.

So, the question is how to make user's life more convenient and keep implementation efforts reasonable while supporting both research and DICOM formats.

One big issue that saving, loading, importing, exporting, and DICOM importing, exporting is all mixed in Slicer. There should be
1. A single-click save option that would save everything into the Slicer database without information loss. The Slicer database would probably save to DICOM files, which would be indexed by a simple database (it would be similar or the same as the current DICOM database).
2. An export option that would bring up a similar dialog box as the current save dialog and could save to either DICOM or research formats.

Before this intermix is cleaned up I would not try to add DICOM saving into the current Save data dialog.

#### 2016-06-23, 09:22:58 - Csaba Pinter
Two more ideas that can be independently done and would help in this issue:
* Making DICOM export more accessible. Right now it is kind of obscure, because you can reach it from DICOM browser by clicking the Export button, and from Subject hierarchy by right-clicking the series or study to export. Maybe adding a fourth button on the Save/Load toolbar for DICOM export would make sense (in that case Subject hierarchy would need to be enabled and the MRML scene parsed when clicking that, because right now unless the user clicks 'Yes to all' when first visiting Subject hierarchy, the SH nodes are not created)
* Integration of DICOM SEG import/export to core

I also agree that mixing non-DICOM and DICOM save would not be the best approach; it is already confusing enough that there are two ways of loading and saving data, but at least so far they have been kept separate.

## #833 Crash in plastimatch proton dose calc
Details reported by Csaba described below.

I just wanted to calculate dose with the Plastimatch proton engine, and had a crash. It happened at the marked line in this screenshot
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3143581/Screenshots/20160808_ProtonCrash.png

## #834 Slicer sometimes crashes during patient similarity cloud process
I'm running 3D Slicer (version 4.5.0 nightly from 2016-03-31) and SlicerRT headless on Amazon EC2 instances in the cloud to compare a series of datasets together. I sometimes observe that Slicer will crash while performing a series of contour comparisons using the Segment Comparison module in SlicerRT. This occurs after loading two DICOM-RT datasets, registering two CT images together using the BRAINS general registration, transforming the CT and structure set from one of the datasets with the resulting transform, writing output to a log file, and starting to compare contours from the two datasets together using the Segment Comparison module. The same instance will have successfully analyzed a number of different datasets this way prior to the crash, and running the same test again later will produce a successful result, so the issue isn't with a single problematic dataset. My logs only unfortunately indicate the step in my dataset comparison process that the crash occurs at. I've encountered this problem in about 0.07% of the dataset comparisons I've done. I'm not sure exactly what is causing the problem, but before the point where it crashes, I added two calls to force Slicer to process events before starting the segment comparison using qt.QApplication.sendPostedEvents() and qt.QApplication.processEvents(), which may be part of the issue, but are needed to get segment comparisons with the correct values when running on the cloud.

## #836 Improve segmentation module display section
The display options in segmentations are currently both too general (one overall visibility checkbox) and too granular (per-segment visibility options in table). It would be needed to expose overall visibility options per display type. The proposed changes:
* Make the display widget re-usable
* Move the Views, Slice intersection thickness, and Representation options to an Advanced groupbox, collapsed by default
* Instead of the overall visibility and opacity, we'd have two columns, one for Slice and the other for 3D. In Slice, there would be visibility and opacity for fill and outline, and one visibility and opacity each in the 3D column. The overall opacity is not necessary, but the overall visibility is.

## #839 DICOM-RT examine and loading crashes on Windows
Somewhere between Oct 22 and Oct 27 there was a change in Slicer core (probably, as there were no changes in SlicerRT in that time) that makes DICOM-RT examine and load crash (with stack overflow) on Windows.

Step 1. The crash seemed to happen due to a vtkStringList incorrectly wrapped and passed from DicomRtImportExportPlugin.py::examineForImport to vtkSlicerDicomRtImportExportModuleLogic::ExamineForLoad. There are two arguments of this function, the other being a vtkCollection which is wrapped and passed successfully. However the vtkStringList seems to become invalid during vtkPythonArgs operations.

Step 2. After further investigation it seems that the stack overflow happens due to declaration of too many DCMTK objects on the stack within one function. After splitting the long vtkSlicerDicomRtImportExportModuleLogic::ExamineForLoad function to multiple smaller ones, the stack overflow is gone. There is still a very similar stack overflow when entering vtkSlicerDicomRtReader::LoadRTStructureSet

## #845 Fix incorrect rendering of beam
Beam models do not render correctly. For example, a 45 degree gantry angle renders as a 45 degree couch kick.

Unfortunately it seems it is necessary to do a major review of the IEC transform logic.
Tasks:
* Write automatic test for Room's Eye View to make sure that the next steps do not change the otherwise correct behavior. Test should tweak the geometric parameters for the linac parts, and verify that the resulting bounding boxes of the models have not changed
* Review and fix vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::CoordinateSystemIdentifier enum, as most items in there (all except for FixedReference) are transform names instead of coordinate frame names
* Complete overhaul of vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::GetTransformBetween. It is entirely hard-coded, and slow
* Once these changes were made so that Room's Eye View still functions correctly, test the beam transformation again

@gregsharp I integrated the Room's Eye View change that fixed the coordinate frame names, but apparently that fix didn't affect the beam geometry. So I will do that fix myself. When do you need it? (I'm in paper writing mode now but can work on this when it's needed)

Ah too bad.  I would like a day or two before I leave (May 5), so I can make screen captures.

OK I'll try to fix it ASAP. If I cannot do that in time with the IEC code I'll just revert to Kevin's hard-coded transforms until I can do it properly later.

Re #845, re #415: Fixed gantry rotation + various fixes in REV and IEC logic

- Gantry rotation from Beams module is fixed by applying the 90 degrees rotation that goes from RAS to FixedReference. Note: This should be a new transform in the logic, as the whole linac needs to be transformed using this as well
- Duplication of definition of transform names removed by declaring static member variables for that in IEC logic and using them from REV logic
- Removed unnecessary error messages (setting NULL beam node is completely valid)
- Fixed typo in include directory variable name, which resulted in not being able to include IEC logic from REV logic
- Renamed CollimatorRotated coordinate system to Collimator. Reasons and concerns (also see TODOs added in the code):
It makes sense that there is a GantryToFixedReferenceTransform that goes from FixedReference to Gantry. Then there is CollimatorToGantryTransform, that goes from Gantry to Collimator. So far so good. Then the problems start:
1. The Collimator coordinate frame was called CollimatorRotated. (this has been renamed to Collimator, that’s how it makes sense, because one cannot go to a coordinate frame that does not exist, i.e. Collimator)
There are two more transforms, called CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform, and FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorRotatedTransform. If the rename from (1) is applied, then they are called CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform and FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorTransform. The problems here are
2. What is FixedReferenceIsocenter? It’s not in the coordinate system list. What do we use it for?
3. In the transform chain there is CollimatorToGantryTransform, under that FixedReferenceIsocenterToCollimatorTransform, under that CollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform. So this chain goes from Gantry -&gt; Collimator -&gt; FixedReferenceIsocenter -&gt; Collimator. This problem has been also explained in the code in:
vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::FIXEDREFERENCEISOCENTER_TO_COLLIMATORROTATED_TRANSFORM_NODE_NAME
vtkSlicerIECTransformLogic::GetTransformBetween (fromFrame == Collimator &amp;&amp; toFrame == FixedReference)
vtkSlicerRoomsEyeViewModuleLogic::UpdateCollimatorToFixedReferenceIsocenterTransform

@gregsharp I think I'm very close now. One thing I suspect is that the couch angle slider never worked. Can you confirm? Or can you remember when it worked?

#### 2017-04-22, 15:32:50 - Greg Sharp
Thanks Csaba!   Yes, I also remember that couch rotation never worked.

#### 2017-04-23, 13:03:03 - Csaba Pinter
The question then is how to proceed?
1. Proper fix: Rearrange the IEC transform logic so that the patient support is basically the RAS coordinate system at isocenter. With this change the beam transform can be accessed with one query, and the linac visualization follows (the whole linac would rotate when the couch angle is changed, so that the patient stays on the couch, and the beam comes from the collimator). This would take more time
2. Quick&dirty fix: I can add a transform separately to the beam for couch rotation. There would be a disconnect between the linac visualization and the beam.

My conclusion is that if you need couch rotation for the demo, then I'll do 2, but if not, then I'll forego the dirty solution and implement 1 in less of a haste a bit later.
Important to note that the gantry angle works properly now. Please test it though. Thanks!

Dose is actually correctly registered.  I thought it wasn't because it was all zeros.  But that was caused by an incorrect assumption in plastimatch that the target shape was sampled with the same geometry as the CT.  (This is now fixed.)

The issue of clobbering is caused by the UI.  The CT gets put as the default value for the 'Output dose volume' combobox.

If you have a suggestion to prevent this, I can implement the change on the UI side.

#### 2017-05-01, 23:10:46 - Greg Sharp
There exists logic to create an new dose output volume (RTPlan_TotalDose) if none is selected. 
It gets trigged when a plan is set.  But somehow I was able to bypass this trigger.
 
That is all I know so far.  Not super urgent, now that I know the workaround.

## #860 ExternalBeamPlanning automatic test fails
http://slicer.cdash.org/testDetails.php?test=7962358&build=1014708
Seems to be happening since the Plastimatch update.

The reason why I set this to highest, is that the dependent extension (GelDosimetry, FilmDosimetry) don't get built if there is any test that fails, see #838. So I'll disable this test until it gets resolved, but we need to make sure we don't end up disabling each test one by one.

@gregsharp , I know you're travelling, and I definitely don't mean to push you. I'll be travelling in the next two days as well. If I get to this first, I'll fix it.

Thanks, Greg!

I moved the EBP tickets in a new milestone so that the tasks are easier to see, I hope it's OK!

#### 2017-05-01, 21:21:45 - Greg Sharp
Yes, I was thinking of separating them out as well. 

Is there a easy way to run just the failing test?

@gregsharp if you don't mind I assign this to you. With the recent Plastimatch updates, building the Plastimatch soultion manually did not always work, so I had to do clean builds. This takes a lot of time, and it would be nice to fix. Not sure when this broke, but the issue seems to be reproducible every time. Thanks!

#### 2017-08-11, 14:26:35 - Csaba Pinter
That said I don't consider this issue to be critical, it's just good to be aware of this and have it in the plans.

## #863 Support plan level dose engine parameters
Some beam parameters should be plan-specific, so that they do not need to be changed in every beam individually. For the proton engine, these are the following: every parameter in the Beam model tab except for smearing radius, and the Source distance parameter in the Geometry tab.

Maybe instead of just implementing this option to specify whether a parameter is beam or plan specific, we can implement beam groups (a feature we discussed earlier) at the same time. Notes about this feature:
* Beam groups: plan contains one or more beam groups, a beam group contains one or more beams
* Properties defined for each beam group, which the contained beams share
** Plugin dose engine
** Isocenter
** Target segment
** Isocenter specification
* Rethink beam cloning

## #865 Histogram from vtkPolyDataDistanceHistogramFilter are sometimes different
https://app.assembla.com/spaces/slicerrt/subversion/source/HEAD/trunk/SlicerRt/src/SegmentComparison/Logic/vtkPolyDataDistanceHistogramFilter.cxx#ln269

The section that accumulates frequencies for the histogram seems to always return a result that *looks* reasonable at first glance... but if you re-run it with the same data, you sometimes get a slightly different result. I don't see any immediate explanation for this behaviour.

## #866 DICOM-RT export incorrectly sets SOP Class UID to US volumes
Modality is set correctly here
https://github.com/SlicerRt/SlicerRT/blob/master/DicomRtImportExport/Logic/vtkSlicerDicomRtWriter.cxx#L234
and for CT and MRI it works fine. But for US, although the Modality tag is correctly US, but the SOP Class UID still shows 'CT Image Storage'.

For MRI, the SOP Class UID is also correct, like this
(0008,0016) UI =MRImageStorage                          #  26, 1 SOPClassUID
…
(0008,0060) CS [MR]                                     #   2, 1 Modality

...

## #867 Transform of beam loaded from DICOM is incorrect
The beam node is loaded and set up correctly, and when changing the beam parameters manually the transform is updated, but right after loading it's incorrect

#### 2017-08-07, 21:05:46 - Csaba Pinter
Fixed #867: Update beam transform explicitly when loading

Transform modified events were invoked before adding to the scene, and processing events in the logic did not happen due to being in batch processing mode, so calling an update method explicitly was necessary after adding the beam to the scene.
